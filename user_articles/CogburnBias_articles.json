Mara suggest 80%) 2021 forward earnings would be about 40mil if btc =50k end of year. 61mil if btc goes to 100k end of year. At 309 million shares that's a Fwd PE of 14 at btc = 50k and 9 btc =100k. If the margins are 80% it brings it down a couple. This doesn't take into consideration increased hash rate going forward and i'm using a pretty low BTC per month estimate. S&P 500 tech stocks aggregate Fwd P/E is about 29. Anyway you look at it this stock is undervalued at 1.60. A triple from here brings it to industry average fwd earnings valuation. I realize there are a few assumptions and this is a rough analysis. Could change quite a bit for the better with more bitcoin mined but I may be leaving out some expenses. Bullish",
