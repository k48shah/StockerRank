In this regard, Russia in March voluntarily cut production by 500 thousand b/d.

But we will evaluate them in the near future,\" Novak said.\n\nHe also clarified that no Russian company has applied for a special permit on the possibility of selling oil or petroleum products within the \"price ceiling\" established by the G7.

        "content": "$VET $KLXE Russia will not sell oil to countries that impose a price cap on its crude exports, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Novak warned on Friday.\n\nAccording to Novak, Moscow may respond by reducing oil production by 500,000-700,000 barrels a day in early 2023. Russia is the world\u2019s third biggest oil producer and the cuts would equate to roughly 5-6% of the country\u2019s daily output.\n\nThe G7 and EU\u2019s $60-per-barrel ceiling on Russian seaborne crude came into force on December 5. The measure, along with a ban on EU imports of seaborne Russian flows, is aimed at curbing the Kremlin\u2019s revenues. Russian oil cargoes that are traded above the threshold cannot access some key services from Western companies, including insurance.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to partially cut our production early next year,\u201d Novak warned in an interview with the Rossiya-24 TV channel.",

The warlord whose men carried out the attack was a long-time resident of Britain and has close ties to the British wing of ISIS. The main purpose of this action, at any cost, is to pit Iran against Saudi Arabia, whose looming rapprochement is seen as a huge threat to Britain and the United States'position in the Middle East.

This is reported by Reuters, citing several sources.\nAccording to the agency, the Central Bank wants state banks to start buying yuan for dollars from their overseas subsidiaries, including those in Hong Kong, London and New York.\nThe simultaneous purchase of yuan while selling dollars should help the national currency strengthen its position, the agency said. The Central Bank took this measure against the background of a significant fall in the yuan against the dollar. Since the beginning of the year the Chinese currency has fallen by more than 11%, and at the end of the year the decline could be a record for the past 26 years.\"",
