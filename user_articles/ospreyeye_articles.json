The candles\u2014with gaps between them\u2014may be consecutive, but they don't need to be. There may be several candles, then a gap, and so on. The appearance of the pattern suggests a trend may be nearing exhaustion and traders should be on the lookout for signs of a reversal.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nThe Rising Three Gaps pattern occurs during an existing uptrend and is formed when there are three gaps higher separated by rising candles.\n\nThe Falling Three Gaps pattern occurs during an existing downtrend and is formed when there are three gaps lower separated by declining candles.\n\nThe gaps may be separated by several candles, not just one.\n\nThe pattern signals the trend may be nearing exhaustion. The latest gap being filled by movement in the opposite direction is a sign of a potential reversal.\n\n$SPX $SPXS $SPXL",

It consists of a white candlestick and a Doji with a gap up at the opening. If the Doji is in the form of an Umbrella the pattern is called \u201cBearish Dragonfly Doji\u201d. In case of an Inverted Umbrella it is called \u201cBearish Gravestone Doji\u201d. Here, all these patterns are subsumed under the name: \u201cBearish Doji Star\u201d, regardless of the shape of the Doji.\n\nRecognition Criteria\n\n1. The market is characterized by a prevailing uptrend.\n2. On the first day a white candlestick is observed.\n3. Then, we see a Doji on the second day that gaps up.\n\nPattern Requirements and Flexibility\n\nThe Bearish Doji Star should start with a normal or long white candlestick. It must continue with a Doji gapping up.\n\n$SPX $SPXS $SPXL",

The signal tells us to STAY LONG, but the chance of a bearish confirmation that will change the signal to <SELL is very high. The Delayed Intraday Module is ON. Given the risks involved, we strongly suggest you to follow price movements on an intraday basis.\n\nThis pattern is characterized by a large black body engulfing a preceding smaller white body, which appears during an uptrend. The black body does not necessarily engulf the shadows of the white body but totally engulfs the body itself. This is an important top reversal signal\n\n$QQQ $SPXS $SPX",
