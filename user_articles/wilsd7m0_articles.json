That little sheetstorm all in the same few days made everyone yell BK!!  That\u2019s what caused the overcorrection. \n\nListen\u2026.no one likes to wait. The market is starting to show some signs of life in the quick runner category but there have only been 1 confirmed that ran correctly and 1 currently going that needs to finish a multi day run still to say 100% that 2 have happened. So candidly where most of us are with our averages on this one\u2026it\u2019s safer to hold this than jump into the runners at the moment. \n\nI could have made $50k today but chose to be safe and watch the one where I could have made it. We will make it here and more if we are right\u2026.it\u2019s soon\u2026patience Bullish",

No Customers like that\u2026especially enterprise\u2026 not to mention the transition to IP telephony and cloud telephony from legacy systems is becoming easier and easier. Rip and replace is still not optimal but it is not like it used to be as far as an impediment\u2026it used to be nearly impossible so companies like Avaya had such a leg up. Candidly if Avaya didn\u2019t service the top of the top as far as businesses and organizations go they wouldn\u2019t be around but because their primary customer base is so massive they just need to provide a seem less roadmap to subscription which I know they are trying to do.

For crypto trading I think people are going to finally understand a big reason why Coinbase went public. So they could be the only CEX that can say they are legally obligated to act as if they are a regulated financial institution with their audits and corporate structure. That\u2019s better than \u201ctrust me\u201d. \n\nAlso the crypto industry is near the bottom. Every single indicator says we are. The big capitulation moment has happened. It could continue yes\u2026but we are close. In correlation to the all time highs we are talking maybe 10% more to the downside\u2026.we are already around 75% down on most assets. \n\nSo I think everyone needs to seriously look at $COIN at these levels. 50% gains look so good for the short term Bullish",

BSed on all of our DD and the historical management from the newer CEO we are all on board with he will work everything out with lenders and get the business moving in the right direction.

Also it has been my experience that probably 90% plus of the time\u2026patience in my firm hold is more profitable than jumping on some emotional trade \n\nGreat example was VG back when it was trading at .30-40cents. Held it a few times on the way up but after it was all said and done if I would have bought and held I would have made multiple 7 figures vs the barely 7 figures I made over the time. No one should feel sorry cause a win is a win but I have so many stories like this over the last 20 years\u2026.if I would have just held on 1..maybe 2\u2026.I may not even be talking to you guys lolololol \n\nThe past 2-3 years I have gotten a lot more patient and a lot less emotional.

No big institution manipulating either side of this to try and manufacture some sort of move either way. \n\nEveryone knows I was a back the truck up guy at $0.90s and $0.80s.

This is not the in and out play at the moment unless you are dabbling with small day trading\u2026or options..or on leverage etc. I mean it is reacting on technicals pretty much text book while this quiet time is going on. Looking to about turn back towards $1.40s in the next day or two. Just channeling between $1.10-$1.40ish. The support and resistances are holding on the different trend sides. I just don\u2019t feel like watching paint dry so not trading in that manner. \n\nAnyways - can\u2019t hardly hold my excitement for the corrected loan/finances and even just a 6month-12 month plan / forecasts\u2026the new one under Alan that is.

If anyone is a chart expert I would love to hear the prediction. I know what I see and I don\u2019t love the set up tmrw.

Already up almost 50%. It\u2019s got great potential to be a big one. I don\u2019t like to mess around with daytrades for 5-10% anymore. Majority of my casino money which I personally mange goes to stocks that have 50-1000s of percent potential. I am willing to stay with them for a while but I usually want these returns in less than 30days and usually the 2week span. If you have patience and experience at baseline stock market and trading in general..especially trends, patterns, golden number stuff and experience in the irrational side of things...this is the route imo.

Near term meaning weeks. I also think in a year to two as long as crisis dissipates which history tells me it will then I think it will be in the $5-$20 range. Huge range but predicting oil price and such is impossible outside of that I definitely know it is going up from here. \n\nI am in this to sell in the $1-2 range then buyback on a pull back.

Well I have to start by saying that this play has been about as frustrating as they come....however at least that frustration has not resulted in a huge loss like what I should be calling frustrating. Now with that said the action is looking decent this morning and it should be interesting if there is anything to it. I did sell around $ 2.11and bought all back at $1.91 as to perform what I call a rechanneling technique. Basically I change up the patterns and price points for my whole model. On AIM this was not for a good reason since I\u2019m rechanneling lower but I still think this has a lot of potential and nothing has changed except the technicals. Now the technicals have not changed drastically YET but they have to hold this $1.90ish level as the bottom or they change drastically (hence why I went ahead and planned for what appears to be the technical future).  Anyways I just wanted to make sure everyone knew where I was at on this and hoping for a great day!!!!!! Bullish",

Which means for continuation of a 4 month uptrend that it will not end the day much lower than where it is at and it CANT stay at these levels for more than another day or two. Watch and see if I\u2019m right but I\u2019m betting that I am. And the other market is brutal right now with offerings and I mean throwing them out without letting the runs happen for long. Which tells me that all these guys know their games are about up with CV in general (in order to capitalize on CV ....well getting institutional money for it anyway...fluff PRs and shit. U better have real legitimate stuff or other rev avenues for your products - which btw we do...so watch companies like us being the ones getting the play and I mean all the play soon) Bullish",
