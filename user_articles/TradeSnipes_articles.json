Hint: seek out what correlates closely and the ETF it falls under and also see how the sector itself is performing. Then focus on in terms of \"risk on and risk off\" what the overall market is looking like. FB will likely fall to 196 in the next 2 weeks. $SPY will move to 325, at most 327, this week and then we will sell off. It would behoove you to enter in FB and replicate a .85 delta in the money put and take it out to March or May (for now). This is my take and the probability leans towards a 98.7% favorable outcome. Open the put on the spike upward on the spy and hold for a minimum of a 10pt drop. Then you can take profit or choose to roll. I have a 170 pt on Fb for the short term and 155 long term. (However be mindful of next earnings). Our spy to me",
