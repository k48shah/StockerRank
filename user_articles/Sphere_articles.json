We are in deep bear territory, so the feelings are relative to that, when we were in bullish territory, the feelings are different.

However, it's the $ that causes max pain, it's the recognition that IOUs being held by brokerages far exceed the float.

I am not here to debate on that, unless it relates to global investments, business transformations & supporting Gov policies to address the climate impacts.  \n \nLet face it, we are debating on this based on our SHORT and LONG positions in $PLUG.  Otherwise, why are you & I here, right? \n \nI am here as an investor first.  I follow global policy makers (Paris Accord), Gov policy makers, DOE funding / tax credits, global investments & partnerships, & customers transitioning their operations to a zero-emission footprint.  None of these entities will put $ into Green H2 & disrupting their existing profitable operations to a cleaner technology, just for the fun of it & going against science. \n \nI will follow big money that potentially leads to a profitable investment in time.  You can follow the scientists. Bullish",
