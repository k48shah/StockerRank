Tesla will go down first more when this B-leg ends. Yes 2000 is extremely high, but market\u2019s psychology will cause high beta\u2019s to be extremely overvalued stocks or extremely undervalued in bearish markets. This 2000 target has nothing to do with Fair Value \u2260 Market value. The market price is just what anyone wants to buy a stock for and fomo will cause extremes again by then.

This implies that selling pressure is decreasing, and buyers are about to take over control. \n- Hence the many shake out wicks last days (stop loss raids) \n- Obviously to run it needs volume. \n- Last attempt on rising volume it got rejected at GREEN Fib 0.5. \n- Last days back down on declining volume = net positive = consolidation. \n- Next attempt to break the 55DEMA I expect price to wick into \"D\" target at minimum:  read back previous post where I pointed it out on the lower timeframe chart. \n- Historically PBTS ran fast up after the weekly closed above the 55DEMA \n- Red areas are liquidity resistance ranges.",

However pre and after hours it could go back up like yesterday when it went up 2% from 39.21 to 40. Monday it also managed to go up during regular hours on the daily from 38.73 to 40.76 = 5.2%. \nRead back this thread with some more charts as the 4H could be just an ABC move down on declining volume which ended in a doji the last 4H. The move up was on rising volume. \n55DEMA  38.10 could also be tested as another shake out wick down though.

Of course the \u201cnews\u201d doesn\u2019t tell you so, but the volume (smart money) spread  has been declining on the weekly, -53% lower than March. TA is leading, the news will follow A F T E R to backup any movements. \nTherefore I expect the next leg up in May to be led by high Beta stocks and the FOMO consensus as usual will be chasing at higher prices, while the contrarians have been positioned already waiting to scale out at the targets mentioned to that same FOMO consensus. \nContrary mindset, patience is a virtue: nothing of my forecast has been invalidated, the only thing that changed is more whining in April about ARKK lagging other indexes while the volume was net positive.
