I like $UPST and $NU (own both), but at $1.18/sh, PGY could easily double or triple from current levels by December 18. Insiders own hundreds of millions of shares yet that are still locked up. They don\u2019t want to be selling at these levels. They wanna be selling at much higher levels.

But here\u2019s the difference. I don\u2019t give a shit about the day-to-day movements. Come 2024-2025, this investment will be worth north of $1 million based on future margin, profitability and EPS projections. Point is, congratulations on preserving your capital. I don\u2019t care because I\u2019d rather pay 20% in capital gains versus 39.5% (state and fed). That requires me to hold stocks for more than one year. So I don\u2019t care if the stock remains below my avg. price for another year. If you\u2019re not in the 37% tax bracket then I guess day trading works. We are both seasoned investors with two different philosophies I guess. But let me congratulate you on that awesome buy!",

The other is not. The exercise price of the tradeable warrants is $7.35 a share. The exercise price of the non-tradeable warrant is $7.65. So take 1.285M shares plus 1.285M warrants that are tradeable, and you have 2.57M shares. Add in 192,799 over-allotment shares plus 192,799 over-allotment tradeable warrants, now we are at 2,955,588 tradeable shares. The placement agent gets 25,507 shrs plus 29,464 shrs from warrants. This puts the tradeable share count at 3,010,559 so far. Debt holders were allowed to convert debt into 2,850,252 shs at $5.25/sh. So now we are at 5,860,811 shs. Finally, 871,240 shares were granted from stock options at an exercise price of $4.06/sh. However, these are locked up. So in total, 5.86M shares are tradeable! Good luck! Pls share Bullish",

It\u2019s based on the Black Scholes formula. Look it up. And since the company issued 3.3 million warrants that can be converted into cashless warrants, that means an additional dilution of another 3.3 million shares AT THE MINIMUM (again, based on Black Scholes). So the investor did not get 4 million shares for $20M. Ultimately, the investor got around 9.3M shares ( based on the formula IN THE FILING) for $20M-at the current share price. But if the stock goes down further, they will get a lot more than an additional 5.3 million shares (if exercised at $4.40/sh). The bottom line is, cashless warrants are a disaster for shareholders if the stock starts going down. It increases dilution substantially and guarantees the investor will MAKE MORE $ if it drops. They don\u2019t care if it goes below $5/share. Hence why they are allowed to short! Bearish",
