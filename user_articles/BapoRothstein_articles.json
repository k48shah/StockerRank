The only benefit I personally gain by posting here is a contemporaneous record to help my effort to learn what not to do in public markets. My posting history spans over a time period that includes my mom\u2019s cancer fight, and me taking her to all of her medical appointments\u2014biopsies, scans, surgery, chemo, radiation, and diagnosis of remission. A good portion of my posts were made sitting in the parking lot of Cedars-Sinai Chemotherapy Infusion Area, so I could see my mom through the window, because Covid restrictions didn\u2019t allow anyone to accompany her. I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t admit that going back and reading some of my older posts gives me the sour taste of penny and nickel. But there\u2019s some pure gold there too, so long as it\u2019s read within the context of knowing the author had very little real-world market experience at the time. Just wanted to remind myself of what I\u2019m still doing here. Bullish",

Disney has been in talks with leagues and rival broadcasters/streamers to make ESPN the hub for all broadcasted/streamed, regionally and nationally, sporting events. Proposal calls for ability to lookup any sporting event and have the ability to gain access to it without leaving the ESPN app, including events streamed and owned by ESPN competitors. Essentially, ESPN app would be the aggregator of all sports streaming, and for the streaming rights owned by ESPN competitors, the ESPN app would natively\u2014on the ESPN app\u2014facilitate signup and collection of fees on behalf of all competing media rights holders. That would be a massive disruption to the current friction caused by current siloed sports streaming app signup situation. No opinion on probability of Disney succeeding in getting this done. @epgrubman, care to share your thoughts?",

I suspect it will go bankrupt within the next 24 months. \n\n Crazy Bernie is an analyst with an average return of -11.0% and a 42.31% success rate. Of all the garbage, capital destroying companies that he covers and likes, including the beauty of all beauties, DKNG, he appears to be most antagonistic towards SGHC, the only profitable and most well-ran company within his universe of bewildering coverage. \n\nHe shouldn\u2019t be allowed to ask questions during our next earnings call. His coverage of SGHC is a disgrace. All he does is chase price action, which means he will almost always be late. He deserves a timeout. We would be better off taking questions from retail shareholders.",
