Pratty points out that all three of these altcoins look poised for another leg higher. As you can see, they\u2019re all breaking out of multi-month bases within strong longer-term uptrends. Crypto held up relatively well this week despite a risk-off tone in the equity markets, and eight-month highs in the US Dollar. You\u2019d expect cryptocurrencies to struggle in that sort of environment, but they didn\u2019t. Quite the opposite actually.

All eyes are on the Russell 2000 as it tests a crucial support level for the fifth time this year. As you can see, Small-Caps have been stuck in a well-defined range between $211 and $233 since March, and we're once again testing the lower bounds of that range. Will the fifth test be a success?  One thing that makes this test unique from the past four is the fact that we're also testing the 200-day moving average (red) for the first time in nearly a year. Small-Caps often lead the broader market higher or lower. So, it would be hard to overstate just how important this test is to the broader equity market. Either way, the Russell is about to give us some valuable information, so pay attention to how $IWM behaves around $211 in the near term.\n\nthechartreport.com/cotd-07-...\n$STUDY $IWM $RUT $RTY_F",

Copper fell to a four-month low in today's session, around 4.11 per pound. Price was in a strong uptrend between March 2020 and May of this year, surging more than 100% in that time. However, it began breaking down in June, and it has continued to trend lower ever since. Due to the metal's numerous industrial uses, Copper often acts as a leading indicator for global economic growth and the stock market. Of course, this is just one data point to consider. But, seeing Copper hit fresh four-month lows like this doesn\u2019t exactly inspire confidence in the bull case.\n\nthechartreport.com/cotd-08-...\n$HG_F $JJCB $FCX $SPX $STUDY Bearish",

Will the fourth time be the charm?

Over the past three sessions, the S&P 500 has formed a bullish candlestick pattern known as the \u201cAbandoned Baby\u201c pattern. As silly as it sounds, there is actually a lot of market psychology behind it. This is a three candlestick pattern in which the second candle gaps down and forms a Doji, followed by a gap higher and a strong green candle. The pattern signals that buyers have regained control after a moment of indecision (yesterday). It\u2019s important to note that this is more of a short-term signal, and it doesn\u2019t tell us where prices are headed over the long run. But, it certainly bodes well for next week!

Generally speaking, the more times a level is tested, the more likely it is to break through. Think of it like hitting a brick wall with a sledgehammer. You might not break through the wall on the first attempt, but each time you hit it, the wall becomes weaker and weaker until you eventually smash through it. It\u2019s also worth noting that Crude Oil\u2019s bullish seasonal pattern doesn\u2019t peak until late September. So, a move higher throughout the Summer months would be in line with seasonality.

The chart shows the S&P 500 as it was recovering from four separate bear markets - 2008-2010 (top left), 2003-2004 (top right), 1982-1985 (bottom left), 1973-1978 (bottom right). JC points out that it's very common to see the S&P 500 trade sideways in the second year of a bull market. As you can see, all four of these recoveries followed the same playbook. There was a strong initial thrust off the lows that persisted for about a year, followed by months of sideways price action. The good news is that the S&P 500 has still logged an average gain of 16.9% in year two of a bull market. But, it's important to keep in mind that sideways price action would be perfectly normal at this point in a bull market cycle. \n\nthechartreport.com/cotd-04-...\n$STUDY $SPX $SPY",

For the first time since the rally began, we're starting to see Bitcoin lose some momentum. On the other hand, the second-largest Cryptocurrency, Ethereum, continues to show strength.

        "content": "Today\u2019s Chart of the Day was shared by Drew Wells. It\u2019s a weekly candlestick chart of the Energy sector ETF, $XLE, over the past six years. The Energy sector is off to a terrific start this year. $XLE is currently up 36% year-to-date, which is more than 2x the performance of the second-best sector (Financials). However, it\u2019s noticeably lagging the other sectors this week, as it runs into former support. This is an important test for the S&P\u2019s hottest sector. As Drew points out, $55 is the line in the sand for $XLE. Above $55 = Bullish. Below $55 = Bearish. In a comment to The Chart Report, Drew added, \u201cThe Energy sector is a good bellwether for the cyclical rotation/reopening trade. Cracking that $55 level gives a lot more confidence in a sustained rotation for those themes, and remaining below suggests that the rip off the March & November lows was more of a mean reversion move.\u201d\n\nthechartreport.com/cotd-03-...\n$STUDY $XOM $CVX $COP",

We can add this to the long list of indicators that are \"overbought\" right now, but let's not forget, overbought readings are often bullish long-term signals. Especially in the case of this particular indicator. Could we get a 5% or 10% correction in the near-term? Sure!

While this is an exciting milestone, there are some other bullish developments in the Crypto market that we want to focus on. The chart shows the alt-coin market cap over the past four years \u2013 so, basically all of the Cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin (ticker symbol: Total2 on TradingView). As Brian points out, the alt-coin market cap is just starting to break out of a three-year base. In a comment to The Chart Report, Brian said \u201cAlts are just starting to break out, which tells me the recent Crypto Bull Market probably isn\u2019t over just yet. If anything, it looks like it\u2019s just starting to heat up. I think we could easily see a scenario where Crypto traders rotate their profits from Bitcoin down the Crypto cap scale into some of the more speculative coins such as Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, Litecoin, etc.\u201d\n\nthechartreport.com/cotd-02-...\n$ETH.X $ADA.X $DOT.X $LTC.X $DOGE.X $BTC.X $STUDY Bullish",

It was essentially the redheaded stepchild of stock market indices, but it has quickly turned into the market\u2019s new leading index. It\u2019s currently up 15% year-to-date, which is more than 3x the S&P 500\u2019s performance and 5x the Dow\u2019s performance over the same period. It\u2019s even outperforming the S&P 500 on a 1, 3, and 5-year basis now as well. Stefan points out that a 10% correction from here would bring us back to levels seen just ten days ago.

Seasonality has been a nice tailwind for stocks since November, but that is no longer the case. The good news? The S&P 500 continues to be in a strong uptrend and the trend is far more important than seasonality. So, the bulls have that going for them.

If you've been following the Cryptocurrency space, you'll recognize that this setup looks very similar to how Bitcoin looked a month ago. Price is attempting to break out of a  multi-year base within a primary uptrend. This is still a crucial level to clear. But if we do break out to all-time highs in the next few weeks, things could get really interesting. With Bitcoin up more than 100% in the past month, it's easy to say the Crypto space is overextended.

The only exception was in 2009 when the index fell 2.59% one month after the signal. As you might know, Semiconductors are found in almost every electronic device.

We saw fresh all-time highs from bellwether industry groups including Transports, Semiconductors, and Home Builders. More notably, market internals improved dramatically. The Advance/Decline line hit an all-time high, and we saw several positive breadth thrusts. Ed points out that one of those breadth thrust signals occurred today when the percentage of S&P 500 stocks above their 10-day moving averages rose above 90% (after falling to at least 10% first). As you can see from the arrows on the chart, these signals are typically associated with lows. Take a look at the summary statistics in the top left corner. The S&P 500 has historically seen above-average returns in both the short and long-term after this signal has fired in the past.\n\nthechartreport.com/cotd-10-...\n$STUDY $SPX $SPY #Breadth Bullish",

While some might view this as an overbought signal, Chris explains that these momentum surges have historically led to further gains for the Russell 2000. Small-Caps tend to be risker and more aggressive than their Large-Cap peers. So, the fact that they've begun to outperform recently demonstrates risk appetite for Stocks as a whole.

A lot of the seasonality stats you see out there use long-term data that typically goes back to the 1950s. We all learned in Statisticstics 101 that a larger sample size is always preferable. But when you look all the way back to 1950, you will have outliers that will skew the data, such as the crash in October 1987. Petr offers a unique perspective on seasonality by only looking at data from the past decade. In a comment to The Chart Report, Petr said, \"I typically only look at more recent data when it comes to seasonality because markets change all too frequently.

One of the tenets of Dow Theory is the idea that you want the companies that produce the goods (Industrials) confirming the trend of the companies that move the goods (Transports). In other words, when one index makes a new high, you want the other index to also make a new high within a reasonable amount of time. As David highlights, Transports printed a new all-time high on Sept. 16th, while Industrials failed to follow suit. It's important to keep in mind that divergences can persist for a while without any major downside follow-through, and it's also entirely possible that the Industrials get their act together and print new highs.

Bespoke points out that Value is having its best month relative to Growth in nearly two decades. This comes after 11 straight months of Growth outperforming Value. This is clear evidence of rotation, which is constructive for the broader market in the long-run. Although this rotation probably feels anything but constructive if you\u2019ve been overweight Growth like a lot of folks out there. For more evidence of this, just take a look at the S&P 500\u2019s new 52-week high list. A few weeks ago, that list was dominated by the sexy mega-cap Growth/Tech names. Today, we\u2019re seeing boring old Value/Industrial names like John Deere and Dollar General hitting new 52-week highs. The question that remains \u2013 is this a sustainable change in leadership?

Since then, Gold has been coiling into a tight range as it digests its early-summer gains. On a relative basis, Ian points out that Gold has been consolidating above support after breaking out of a multi-year base. If this consolidation resolves higher, it will mean Gold is reasserting its leadership over Stocks.

As you can see, September has been the worst month for stocks over the past 20-years, with the S&P 500 falling 0.80% on average. In a recent note, seasonality expert, Jeff Hirsch pointed out that September has been slightly better in election years, but still negative. This seasonal headwind is certainly something to keep in mind as we begin the new month. However, 2020 has been anything but \"typical\" so far, and the market has completely ignored its seasonal pattern. The \"Sell in May & Go Away\" crowd has missed out on a 24.5% gain since May 1st. Will the bears come out of hibernation this month? Or will the S&P 500 extend its monthly winning streak to six? Stay tuned!\n\nthechartreport.com/cotd-09-...\n$SPX $SPY $STUDY #Seasonality",

Throughout the recovery from the March lows, many have been quick to get bearish at the first sight of momentum divergences. A bearish momentum divergence is formed when price and RSI fail to make new highs together. Steve uses this chart of the Tech Sector ETF, $XLK, to emphasize the fact that these are simply potential momentum divergences until they're confirmed by price closing below the former highs. In February, a potential divergence formed and was later confirmed when price closed below the January highs. A few weeks ago, a similar divergence formed, except this time, price failed to confirm that divergence by continuing higher. Momentum divergences are an incredibly useful tool and they're always worth being aware of. However, it's important to be patient and wait for price to confirm a divergence before getting aggressively bearish.\n\n$STUDY $XLK\nthechartreport.com/cotd-08-...",

You may not breakthrough on the first few attempts, but each time you hit the wall, it gets weaker and weaker until you finally smash through.

Jurrien points out that this recovery rally looks very similar to the recovery from the March 2009 low, in terms of both price and breadth. As we discussed on Friday, the fact that price and breadth have begun to diverge has caused some concern that we're due for a decline. As you can see, breadth was also diverging in 2009, and yet price ultimately resolved higher. Analog charts like this can be tricky because we know history doesn't repeat exactly.

On the other hand, when the three-month performance has been negative, the sitting President tends to get the boot. There have been three exceptions to this phenomenon in 1956, 1968, and 1980. But overall, the S&P 500\u2019s three-month performance has correctly predicted 20 of the past 23 elections since 1928 for an impressive 87% success rate.

When they close at the upper end of a trading range like this, it\u2019s hard to interpret it as anything but bullish in the near-term.\u201d Essentially this candle reflects the aggressive buying that occurred in the final hours of the day. Seeing that kind of surge going into the end of the day/week/month like this is certainly not bearish.\n\nthechartreport.com/cotd-07-...\n$QQQ $NDX $STUDY",

Intel ($INTC) gapped lower by more than 13% at the open last Friday, after the company reported earnings the night before. It's down another 6% so far this week. As Brian points out, the last two times Intel gapped lower after earnings like this, price went on to make another double-digit (%) leg lower over the following weeks. It's easy for a novice trader to be tempted to \"buy the dip\" after an earnings gap like this. After all, you're supposed to buy low and sell high, right? Well, as we know, markets tend to trend.

Renaissance notes \"A positive relationship means the group will decline when the Dollar declines, a negative relationship implies strength when Dollar weakens.\" Notice that value-oriented sectors like Materials and Energy tend to benefit from a weaker Dollar. On the other hand, Growth-oriented sectors like Software, Biotech, and Semiconductors tend to be hurt by a weaker Dollar.

A bounce in the near-term would not be a surprise. But, longer-term, price has made a series of lower highs and lower lows, telling you that the path of least resistance is...you guessed it, lower. The recent weakness in the Dollar has provided a boost to Stocks, Commodities, and even Bitcoin. Gold has perhaps been the biggest benefactor of a weaker Dollar.

The yellow metal bottomed out in 2015 not long after Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Zweig famously called Gold a 'pet rock.' Ironically, this unsexy 'pet rock' has essentially become a momentum trade at this point. It has outperformed the S&P 500 across multiple time frames. As of today, Gold has booked both a 7-day and 7-week winning streak. So, is Gold too far extended in the near-term? Or, do we buy the long-term breakout? Ed's chart shows Gold in relation to its 200-day moving average over the past 20-years. It's currently about 17.5% above it's 200-day moving average. While 17.5% is relatively extended, it's not quite a historical extreme.

As Arun points out, this chart belongs in the textbooks, because it illustrates several classic chart patterns and technical concepts. The stock first got our attention in September of last year. At that point, price was testing resistance at $45 after forming a large base over the past year. In October, price broke out from that base and rallied 35% to a peak of $60 over the next four months. The stock then fell 25% along with the broader market earlier this year, causing price to retest former resistance around $45. Price briefly broke down, but quickly reclaimed that key $45 level. This confirmed a failed breakdown, which helped ignite a 68% rally over the past four months.

In a tweet yesterday, Linda pointed out that this ratio has already put in a lower high on the daily chart, and could soon put in a lower low. The fact that you can\u2019t even see short-term weakness on this long-term monthly chart speaks to how extended this relationship has become over the past few years.

Silver has been gaining a lot of attention lately, and rightfully so. Silver Futures surged 7% today to a 4-year high of $21.68 per ounce.  This is pretty remarkable considering that in March, Silver was trading at its lowest level in over a decade, around $11.75 per ounce. That\u2019s an 83% rally in just four months\u2026talk about momentum! Today marks the 10th time since 1967 that Silver hit a 4-year high for the first time in over a year. The table shows the prior nine instances, along with the short and long-term forward returns. On average, the short-term returns (1-week & 1-month) following this signal have historically been lackluster, while the longer-term returns (3-month, 6-month, 1-year) have been quite positive.\n\nthechartreport.com/cotd-07-...\n$SI_F $SLV $SIL $SILJ $XAU Bullish",

Price is currently about 45% above the March low and less than 4% below the February high. At this point, the February 24th gap is just about the only thing standing in the way of current price and all-time highs.

In a separate comment, Michael said, \"There's one gap left on the chart of the S&P 500 and we need 3,328 to fill it (about 2.25% higher).\" If price can fill that gap, there will be very little overhead supply to prevent the S&P 500 from printing all-time highs.

In a comment to The Chart Report, Ian told us, \u201cThe numerator in all four ratios (Nasdaq, Growth, Mega-Cap Growth, and Tech) are all correlated to each other, and so are the denominators (Russell 2000, Value, Small-Cap Value, and Financials). So when the relative trend changes for one, you usually see it in all the relationships.\u201d Notice that in recent months, when all four ratios are trending lower, the S&P 500 has risen. On the other hand, when all four ratios are trending higher, the S&P 500 has stalled out. In recent days, all four ratios have begun to trend lower.

It's simple. When price is at an all-time high, there's little to no overhead supply to act as resistance, leaving the potential for significant upside. Gold peaked in 2011 around $1,900 per ounce, before tumbling about 45% to a low of $1,050 in late 2015. Flash forward to today, and price is just 5% below the 2011 all-time highs. Well, here's some good news for Precious Metals bulls - Gold is already at an all-time high when we remove our home country bias and look at Gold priced in other major world currencies.

Gold has stolen the spotlight in recent weeks, but perhaps Silver is the metal we should be watching in the near-term. Tom points out that Silver Futures are currently testing a crucial resistance level around $19 per ounce. Price has tested and failed at this level four times in the past year. Will the fifth time be the charm? In a comment to The Chart Report, Tom explained, \"In addition to acting as short-term resistance, $19 has served as support/resistance since 2013, so a move above it would confirm the same type of structural breakout we saw in Gold last summer.\" As we know, Silver is perceived as risker and more aggressive than Gold. Gold Bugs want to see Silver join the party by breaking above $19 in the near-term, as this would demonstrate risk appetite for Precious Metals as a whole.\n\nthechartreport.com/cotd-07-...\n$SI_F $SLV $SIL $XAU $GDX $AG $STUDY",

Momentum indicators, like the MACD (above), and RSI (not shown), have been negatively diverging from price. Breadth indicators like the % of stocks above their 50, and 200-day moving averages have also been weakening. Bulls want to see these breadth and momentum indicators hitting new highs along with price, rather than diverging like they are now.

Ian lets us in on a little industry secret - stocks have been in a primary uptrend for decades. For this incredibly simple reason, it generally pays to be an optimist in this business. So does this mean we should be Perma bulls? No. As we know, secondary trends exist within the primary trend, and when those shorter-term trends are down, it's wise to be tactically bearish. Also, primary trends aren't guaranteed to last forever, just ask Japanese investors. But as long as this chart is moving up and to the right, it makes sense to be a long-term bull on US Stocks.

The yellow metal has outperformed stocks in recent years, and today hit its highest level since 2012. Price has formed a massive base in that time and is now testing the 2011 all-time highs, around $1,800-$1,900 per oz. Carter describes the price action in Gold as 'truculent' - meaning aggressively self-assertive (don't worry we had to google it too). Now, let's not get ahead of ourselves, this is still a crucial test for Gold. Price still needs to break above those 2011 highs in the next few months. But if it does, there's virtually no immediate resistance to stop it from moving significantly higher over the next few years.\n\nthechartreport.com/cotd-06-...\n#GOLD $GC_F $GLD $GDX $GDXJ $STUDY Bullish",

A consolidation or brief pause following that massive rally is healthy in order for price to continue higher. $33 remains a critical support level.

Over the past couple of months, we've witnessed clean breakouts from the Gold Miners ETF, $GDX, and the Silver Miners ETF, $SIL. Chris points out that the Junior Gold Miners are attempting to make a fashionably late appearance to the party. Similarly to how $GDX and $SIL looked before they broke out, $GDXJ has formed a seven-year base, with a well-defined resistance level around $51. If $GDXJ can finally break out of this massive base, it would demonstrate risk-appetite, and provide further evidence that Precious Metals are in a bull market.\n\nthechartreport.com/cotd-06-...\n$GDXJ $GDX $SIL $XAU $JNUG $GLD $SLV $GC_F $SI_F Bullish",

In blue is a 3-day moving average of the CBOE Equity Put/Call Ratio over the past five years, along with the S&P 500 in the upper pane. The Put/Call Ratio is a short-term sentiment indicator. Protective put buying pushes the ratio higher, signaling fear. On the other hand, speculative call buying pushes it lower, signaling optimism. Like most sentiment indicators, it\u2019s best used as a contrarian indicator, especially at extremes. Willie points out that the Put/Call ratio has fallen below 50%. This essentially means that for every 100 calls bought, less than 50 puts were bought. This is the lowest reading since the S&P 500 peaked in mid-February. This development is raising concerns that market participants are overly optimistic and too complacent in the near-term.

The table shows the S&P 500 forward returns over the next 20, 65, 125, and 250-days following the best 40-day % gains. On average, both the short-term and long-term returns have been positive, with an average gain of 16.3% over the next 250-days. As Strategas points out, several of these dates coincide with major lows in the S&P 500. 2001 was a clear outlier with the index falling 20.6% over the next 250-days. However, overall returns following some of the best 40-day gains have been pretty strong.

As Chris points out, price has been stuck in a range between two key Fibonacci retracement levels for weeks now. The 61.8%  Fibonacci retracement of the Feb-March crash has been acting as resistance (purple), while the 50% retracement has been acting as support (yellow). Despite being up an impressive 30% from the March low, the S&P 500 has made little progress (+1.65%) over the past month. Keep an eye on this range in the near term. A meaningful breakout above resistance (around 2930) would be a big win for the bulls, while a break of support (around 2784) would favor the bears.\n\nthechartreport.com/cotd-05-...\n$SPX $SPY $ES_F",

Failed breakdowns, or bear traps as they\u2019re often called, can lead to sharp rallies. Think about it, when price breaks below a well-defined level, longs get stopped out and bears pile in short. If price fails to follow through to the downside, and instead quickly gets back above that level, it tempts longs to re-enter and forces shorts to buy-to cover.

The blue indicator in the lower pane is a 4-week moving average of the bull-bear spread from the weekly AAII Sentiment Survey. This indicator is at its lowest reading since March 2009, which tells us sentiment is extremely bearish right now. As we know, sentiment is often a contrarian indicator, especially at extremes. The fact that the bull-bear spread is at an extreme low (under -20) should be interpreted as bullish, right? Not so fast. Urban points out that during bull markets, extreme bearish sentiment readings (green vertical lines) are often a sign that the S&P 500 has put in a low. On the other hand, in bear markets, these signals are virtually meaningless, as shown by the red vertical lines. If we\u2019re truly in a bear market regime here, using this popular sentiment gauge as a contrarian indicator is not all that useful. \n\nthechartreport.com/cotd-05-...\n$SPX $SPY $STUDY",

Think of these triangle patterns like the tightening of a spring, where the potential energy builds up as it is tightened. Similarly, as the range tightens and price makes its way towards the apex, the potential for an explosive move builds. Eventually, price will have to resolve higher or lower from this pattern. As Tarek notes, triangles often resolve in the direction of the underlying trend, which in the case of Gold, is higher. Either way, you can anticipate a strong move out of this consolidation in the near-term.\n\n$GC_F $GLD $GDX $GDXJ $STUDY\nthechartreport.com/cotd-05-...",

The answer to that question requires a deeper look within the S&P 500. After all, it's a market of stocks, not a stock market, right? There's a clear bifurcation going on within the S&P 500 right now. The five largest stocks in the S&P 500, FAAMG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google) are screaming to new highs, while the rest of the components in the S&P 500 struggle. FAAMG (in blue) is up 49% since January 2018 while the rest of the S&P 500 (in orange) is down about 46% over the same period. This tale of two markets has left the S&P 500, as a whole, virtually unchanged over the past two and a half years. \n\nthechartreport.com/cotd-05-...\n$SPX $SPY $META $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $GOOG $FNGU",

Earlier today,  a report from Bloomberg revealed that legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones II is long Bitcoin. Paul Tudor Jones is highly respected in the technical community for amassing a multi-billion-dollar fortune by observing price action and riding trends. In regards to his Bitcoin position, Jones commented: \u201cBitcoin reminds me of gold when I first got in the business in 1976...Gold had just been productized as a futures instrument (like Bitcoin recently) and had enjoyed a heck of a bull market, almost tripling in price. It then corrected almost 50% in nearly two years similar to Bitcoin\u2019s 28-month 80% correction! You can see the similarities in the two charts.\u201d As we know, history never repeats itself exactly, so it\u2019s always good to approach these analog charts with a healthy degree of skepticism. However, his comments are certainly worth considering. \n\n$BTC.X $GBTC $GLD $GC_F Bullish",

After testing and failing at this level numerous times over the past few months, Ian points out that price has finally made a decisive breakout. Identifying support & resistance levels like this simplifies trading decisions by providing you a clear level to trade against. In this case, if price is above $2.00, the risk is to the upside.

In the article, Matt discusses the third Bitcoin \u201chalving\u201d event that is expected to occur around May 11th or 12th. This event is programmed into bitcoin\u2019s code to take place every four years. It essentially reduces the reward given to miners by 50% per block mined. Matt explains: \u201cbitcoin has thrived in the wake of its previous two halving events (though we\u2019d be remiss not to remind readers that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future returns!). From a purely supply and demand perspective, a bullish reaction to supply cuts makes sense; after all, at current prices, the amount of newly-created bitcoin each day (which is usually sold into the market by miners) will drop from $16M to closer to $8M. In this way, it\u2019s not surprising that the previous two bitcoin halvings kicked off huge rallies of 10,000% and 2,500%, respectively.\u201dforex.com/en/market-analysi...",
