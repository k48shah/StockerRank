There is no reasonable scenario in which everyone works from home forever (not plausible); + there is a greater need for residential high rises (ex. Miami).\n\nBased on that + shifts towards energy efficiency, I see opportunity for View moving forward, & if the hype re: their patents is true, this could be one of the most innovative/disruptive co. since what $TSLA was able to accomplish in the automotive space.\n\nNow all that remains is to see Wall St.\u2019s appetite post merger.  All price movements until then don\u2019t matter imo.  $25+ by EOY would be great.",

Now; $12 minimum.\n\nInstead of the CFII calls, I finished increasing my position in $EVFMD by 2x.  I bought the Jan 2023 $2 calls (also grossly under priced imo at $2.50) strictly to reduce the Capital outlay right now as I plan on exercising the calls.

To me, the sound is amazing.  I played one of my favorite jazz tracks, Idle Moments by Grant Green, and was hooked.  Now I want one in a few more rooms, plus the sub-woofer.\n\nI\u2019m planning on buying another speaker (new) this week & will gradually add the rest over time.  It\u2019s very hard for a hardware company to pull that off, most are happy w/repeat customers every 3-5 year cycle (think $FIT).  Even $AAPL, folks hooked on a phone upgrade every 3 years, but that\u2019s probably it.  No one buys a laptop & immediately thinks \u201cI need another one\u201d.\n\n$TSLA is probably the closest thing; folks buy the car and think \u201cI want the truck too\u201d which is crazy since it\u2019s a $90K purchase.\n\nThat\u2019s a winning formula.",

The thesis of the tenant is that as the family manages the business to increase their wealth, you benefit (like the little fish that swim along bigger fish enjoying the flow of the current with minimum effort).\n\nThis is a very boring, non-fancy business with good fundamentals & a divi track record.  The 5yr chart is beautiful with 100% appreciation in value, and the inception to date chart (ITD) is even more gorgeous with a 540% gain over the past 25 years (+ a divi on top).\n\nAs I tweak my LT philosophy, I love coming across findings like this.

If Tutes dumped billions in above $800 ($969 ATH), this is almost guaranteed to get back to the ATH very soon.  No institutional fund will allow that massive of a loss to be on their books by the end of the year.\n\nIf not buying shares outright, I still like the Jan 2022 $1,500 calls at $8,800 per call.  Using the options calculator, if TSLA hits $1K by this June (easy), the call would be worth $12K.  If it hits $1,500 by 1/1/21, it would be worth $33K.  $1,500 may seem impossible but it is conceivable that Tutes that purchased today\u2019s offering or at prices above $800 could run this up 100% this year.

Along with deep pockets (after having bought the Kors biz outright, IPO\u2019ed it, and pocketed $400M), he still owns 1-2% of the company after his last stock purchase, so it would seem that his interests are aligned.\n\nIt is almost certain that growth will take a hit this year due to the Asia issue; so the question becomes how long will it take to fulfill the $8B conglomerate vision, will the stock offer a better entry point, and will mgmt make any more bad decisions?",

        "content": "$PGNY made the decision to sell my call options on this one at a loss due to the recent volatility and pullback BUT, I bought the shares outright at $28.25\n\nIt might seem hasty to take a loss so early prior to them reporting ER, and it is, but here\u2019s my logic.  I\u2019ll take the loss on options if I can buy the shares outright at a price lower than I would\u2019ve paid to exercise the calls.  Ex. I bought the Dec $25 calls for $12+ (also had the July $15s).  When I sold, I took a loss of roughly $300\n\nBy buying near $28, I eliminate the time decay risk, and set myself up for greater returns as I now own the shares so once this crosses $31, I\u2019m break-even on that $300 loss and anything above that is more than I would\u2019ve made in gains waiting for it to hit $37.\n\nIf it hits $37 by Dec (which it definitely should), I\u2019d be up $900+ or more (assumes one call exercised for 100 shares), so the $300 loss on the calls is mute.  This is a simple example of managing risk.",

        "content": "$AMZN today should be very interesting.  If they pin this and don\u2019t allow it to close above the ATH of $2,035, I don\u2019t know what additional evidence is needed to prove that the market is controlled by deep pocket large capital funds, and the only weapon that regular retail investors such as myself have in our arsenal is good analysis and time.\n\nST trades puts anyone trading with less than $1M at a disadvantage, no matter how right you might be in determining where the stock is ultimately headed, especially with options trading.  You simply can\u2019t get around the fact that big money can dictate ST action.  The best approach is to either invest for the LT, or if trading options, make the trade that is at least 6 months out or more.\n\nBought June 19th $2,500 calls earlier this week (see post from 1/27/2020) for $4.60.  Should AMZN hit $2,100+ today; yes.  Will they allow it to; not sure, but I am confident that it will hit $2,300+ before June 19th.  Low risk, high reward, time is on my side.",
