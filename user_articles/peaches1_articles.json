I wouldn't be surprised if this drug is sold for next to nothing.  \n\nThe SP isn't that shocking seeing how its OTC. OTC the MM only has to fill 100 shares up or down regardless of the bid or ask so it is very easy to manipulate and can be challenging to get in or out. I think someone is unloading big time and they're using the MM to keep SP up as they dump their shares. OTC is junk it is a bitch to trade. You have to find the right routes and even then they can just skip your orders or barely fill you or take 5 mins to fill.. it's just a pain and you have to be very careful. Bearish",

I cannot remember exactly but I believe around 2029 the exclusivity of the drug expires which means by the time this is approved there's a pretty slim time margin to profit.  \n\nThis is the best-case scenario, of course, there's the high likely hood this just fails P3 or gets poor data. \n\nI have no idea why anyone would be holding this there's just so much risk for so a little reward. You don't hold a penny stock that has no money and no obvious incoming catalysts. This is holding 0.50 on fumes. At this point its either you're going to break even or go broke. \n\nEven technically speaking the chart is horrible to be holding. 0.60,0.70,0.80,0.90, 1.10, 1.20 are all resistances Bearish",
