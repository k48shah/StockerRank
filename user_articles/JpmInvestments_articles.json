Say your average winning day is $200/day, but when you have a losing day you lose $600 or $700. Under these conditions, even if you win about 80% of trading days (16 out of 20 days a month) you are just barely breaking even.\n\nIf you applied a daily stop loss in your system, you could greatly reduce the amount you give back on losing days, which in turn creates a consistent monthly day trading income.\n\n$AAPL $SPY $AMZN $TSLA $COIN",

You must know what information you will need to make the appropriate decision on entering or exiting a trade. Some people choose to look at the underlying fundamentals of the economy as well as a chart to determine the best time to execute the trade. Others use only technical analysis. \n\nIt\u2019s also important to have some idea of your destination and how you will get there. Consequently, you need to have clear goals in mind, then ensure your trading method is capable of achieving these goals. Each trading style has a different risk profile which requires a certain attitude and approach to trade successfully.\n\nJust be sure your personality fits the style of trading you undertake.

That alone shows weakness and should be considered as a bearish signal, for right now. \nHowever the RSI has hit today the bottom of the bottom of my Support Zone (the same low was made on June 08).

Currently, there's alot of talk going on that BTC is going to retest the 27k-28k mark with a possibility of low 20s. Volume is currently very low and if so, it's going to be a stalemate of bulls and bears waiting for each other. With that in regard, it has alot to do with how the Whales will come in to affect the market, because that will be the ultimate driving force. \n\nFrom a technical standpoint, I believe that, What crosses the Bollinger Band mid line, will ultimately make it's way to the other end. In this case it has already crossed up the mid line, which is a MA 20. What we need for that to reach the other end though, is volume . On the left side, I've circled an instance where the MACD has made a small 2nd green wave. That's exactly what we need to look out for to see this upward climb to continue. \n$ETH.X $DOGE.X $ADA.X $XRP.X",

This is often regarded as the accumulation phase and institutional buyers are causing the FUD in the market.
