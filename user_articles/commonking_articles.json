Start by making a list of stocks that you are comfortable with, know how they trade, know who owns/trades them and why, and ignore everything else. Who cares about the SPAC of the day, if not on your list, it does not exist.  A trade journal is a good way to start. You are largely on your own in this game and a huge aspect is controlling your emotions and having true conviction is reliant on you defeating your inner urge to puke or take profits too soon or buy at the exact wrong time.

If you think you'd panic/reduce on a drop to $125, probably logical to reduce now at $180 (if LT cap gains in taxable acct). Holding forever is much easier said than done... do you have a target % position? Is it currently much larger than target? Is does daily vol from $SQ represent a large % of your PnL? Too much? Do you have another idea that you would buy (ideally one you like more)? Hard to go wrong locking in $100+/share gains. Which will negatively impact you more mentally and potentially disrupt your process? Selling and seeing it go higher, or not selling and seeing it go lower?",
