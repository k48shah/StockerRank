Many oil companies did this after oil crashed and they struggled to handle their debt load.

Some stocks never recover. So there's that aspect. \n \n$HYG yielded around 4.5% last year while $SPY yielded around 1.5%.

You can get the same capital appreciation in bonds by buying them cheap when yields are high as you can in stock. \n \nBut higher yield generally = higher risk. That goes for high dividend stocks too. Those are sometimes value traps. \n \nOil stocks had incredible dividend yields after oil crashed in 2020 and those stocks got cheap. $XOM for example was at $32/share in Nov 2020 with a 9%+ dividend yield. That dropped to just over 3% recently as the stock climbed to $115. \n \nAs asset prices recover yields fall. Both stock and bonds. \n \nSo hunting for high yields is a pretty good strategy, assuming the entity in question is financially sound. Then you're just buying at a discount. It's why I like treasuries right now, because I don't think these yields will last. In recession corporate yields often jump while government yields fall, creating the spike in my chart above.

Though we had a 16 day government shutdown in 2013, it doesn't seem to get nearly as much attention as the 2011 fight. Maybe it's because the 2011 budget act gave us Sequestration, which were automatic budget cuts in the federal government. Stock market didn't like that and dumped during the 2011 fight. It went up during the 2013 fight. \n \nAnyway - short term yields spiked UP into both 'crises' as you would expect, as investors were not bidding bonds at risk of 'default'.

There is no default risk in a treasury (debt ceiling drama aside). So flight to safety kicks in and treasuries get a bid, particularly given treasury bonds collateralize the entire financial system which is a permanent bid of sorts. Not mortgages and not corporate debt. \n \nDuration has ALREADY gotten steamrolled, which is why we have a solvency problem in the banking sector.

Starting last month the yield spread between 3 month and 1 month treasury bills has widened to levels never seen before. \n \nThe explanation I've seen going around is that the worry over the debt ceiling is creating an enormous bid on 1 month treasuries, driving that yield down as opposed to 3 month bills. This is plausible. \n \nBut we didn't see this happen during the past 2 debt ceiling \"crises\" in 2011 and 2013, the first of which had the US credit rating downgraded, while the latter involved a prolonged government shutdown. Yields were near zero then at the time, but still the spread didn't widen. \n \nSo what's happening now is WTF worthy. I don't really have an explanation. In 2011 stocks declined during that debt ceiling fight. There was also a sovereign debt crisis happening in the EU. In 2013, equities weren't really phased. \n \nMake of this what you will.",

Think about that. It took a generational rise in inflation to cause the largest bond route in 43 years. \n \n2. The peak in RSI occurred in October of last year, which is when the current rally or \"bull market\" in stocks started. Rising yields have been the primary cause of the bear market so far (IMO). When that pressure reversed last October and yields rolled over, stocks began rallying and reversing some of the valuation losses. That's it. \n \n3. Prior monthly RSI peaks (marked with blue columns) marked the end of tightening and led to a period of months or years of declining yields over the past 40 years. \n \n4. We're now sitting on \"the trendline\" which rising yields have bounced off of since 2020 market crash. I think this will break and yields will go much lower. The deteriorating economic backdrop supports that view.",

Technicals are fine for shorter term trades, lont-term analysis should include interest rate cycles. \n \nHere's a chart with $LQD flipped upside down, paired with moody's corporate bond yields (since it goes back much further) and the Fed Funds rate. \n \nThis drop in corporate bonds through 2022 was the largest non-recessionary drop we've seen, if you believe last year wasn't a recession. The recession debate gets decided by NBER at a future date. I think we're already in one, but ultimately they decide at some point. \n \nPros: Corporate bonds have already had a recession-tier sell-off. So we're likely close to a bottom with big upside ahead. \n \nCons: Defaults increase during recession and there has been no \"credit event\" alongside Fed rate cuts which often tanks corporate bonds with a short lived, but sharp drop. I still think that risk is real, which is why I prefer treasuries for now.",

        "content": "@Royaljaguar @OldFngPELK Best bull case for stocks is falling yields. The market could find itself in a goldilocks phase where everything seems ok for awhile. \n \nIt's not a coincidence that $TLT bottomed in October along with $SPY about a week apart. Falling yields allow for higher PEs and richer valuations, all else being equal. \n \nThink of it like a hurricane. Phase 1 the hurricane passes through: Bonds sold off last year, sending yields higher. This made stocks comparatively more expensive, so they got priced down too. Hence the expensive, growthy stuff got hit hardest while value took more modest hits as it was already cheap. \n \nWith peak inflation behind us, bond prices can reflate and stocks can tag along. The storm has passed and now you're in the eye of the hurricane (phase 2). \n \nIf the economy has been irrevocably damaged by rate hikes, yields will fall further as recession takes hold and stocks will sell-off again. <--- This is the part we don't know yet.",

We run trade deficits (we import more than we export) so typically net exports only jump when import demand is weak. Consumer spending is the majority of GDP, and it was positive in Q4, but down from Q3. Likely more slowing consumer growth is ahead in Q1. \n \nPlateauing or declining import/export figures are common at the end of rate hiking cycles and the start of recessions.

He reminds me of $GS Jeff Currie who was pushing $150+ oil all year. \n \nI do agree with him about services and the next capex cycle. Service companies will benefit from that. However, when the next capex cycle hits, earnings for producers spending all that money will fall. That's why investors have been pressuring oil companies not to drill. They don't want a repeat of the shale boom where all the profit went into the ground, driving up supply, ultimately ruining margins and returns. \n \nBut capex is inevitable. Every company has to invest. What's happening in energy reminds me of a company closing down. They sell off all their existing inventory, they're not having to spend money to replenish that stock, so you end up with a massive windfall of free cash flow. But you can't operate a business like that long term. It's only temporary. \n \nSo combine no capex + high oil prices and you get today's unsustainable earnings.",

And it's very hard to say where the world will be in 20 or 30 years given the rate of change at this period in human history. \n \nA couple months back Zoltan Poszar from $CS was claiming the world would be going back to some neo-bartering system because commodities are the future.

So I don't find multi-decade economic forecasts useful for investing or trading. \n \nBut it's a long article, is there something specific you were wondering about?

Doesn't mean it will happen (market will keep pricing in higher fedfunds until Fed pauses and they end up overshooting). But 5% on the short end, which is a big move from here. Fed Funds would target 4% if we get 75bps at the Nov meeting. So you need another 1% on top of Nov. \n \nFurthermore, long term yields during yield curve inversions are lower than short term yields. So for the long end to hit 5%+ and send $TLT to $85, short term rates would need to be far higher than even the market is pricing in at this point. \n \nI think people hoping to catch $85 will be disappointed.
