Can you talk more about why you think Connected TV is a larger opportunity than audio, talk adoption, growth drivers, etc..\n\nAnswer: We have not given audio which includes Spotify and Pandora the attention they deserve. Audio grew by 3x for third quarter in a row which is unbelievable given how long they have been in audio.\n\nOne of the reasons I call it such a great value is that there may not be a form of advertising that captures your attention much better than audio. Way less likely to skip an ad than if you're watching Youtube or in front of a computer. More likely to give it your attention in some cases and rates are usually a fraction of the price.\n\nSo it represents a large opportunity. Growth of podcasting has been helpful and it continues to represent a huge opportunity.",

Why is growth currently limited there?\n\nQuestion: Can you quantify incremental amount of CTV inventory that $AMZN deal brings to you?\n\nAnswer: It is very early stage for $TTD. Nothing is characterized as \"limiting\" these partnerships are new and we are growing them. We are seeing growth every single month but we are being slow and very deliberate. More to come on plans with this before EoY. Things in China are going well and we are playing the long-game.\n\nThis is the strategy that makes Jeff Green and team one of the best in the world.
