As we enter the weakest week of the year (following Quad Witch Sept), surely the odds favor more downside.\n\nBut this market has a way of bouncing off any dip, the current one being 2.8% off the recent high for  SPY, which is nothing for an index up 103% from the 3/23/20 Pandemic low.   \n\nBut with so many chartists watching the same level, there could be a bigger sell off, support is at the 100 DMA at 431.8.",
