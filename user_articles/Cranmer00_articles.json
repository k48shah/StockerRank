Which I was perfectly ok with, buttttttttttt when the platform that everyone is loading up on ends up restricting them to only buying 1-20 shares though is put in place, now even the pump cannot survive so what was INSANE before , ( but i understand the historic retail banging pump and why ppl bought ) is now just moronic with the restrictions in place and it's sad because I will be one of the ones picking up the pieces and trying to get ppl back on their feet. #gme #amc #wsb #pumpanddump \n\nIf you are aware of what you are trading, then you'll be fine.

It's coming to the point of now or never, and would buy now, but would set Stop loss not far at all under 2\n\n@Stockupbiocat We started the swing on $BDRX at 1.30 and Put it atop our swings list for 4-5 days until launch to 7$ .. We love to load right before monster breakouts and be there before everyone else unless the ones holding for weeks-months obviously. This is the first time I would look at reentry for DCB is at this 2.01 area triple doji could form DCB Scalp/reversal\n\n@Rjb1157 $NDRA making a bull flag here , needs to hold .94 20/50d SMA as support and once it finally fills over the monster 200d SMA resistance, We would be in business for BOOOM town\n\nBIIIIIIIIIIIIIG PLAYS coming this week, make sure to check our stream, Because I know the Team is gonna get Paiiiiiiiiiiiiiid alllllll da monies! \n\nGood luck to all, Good night!
