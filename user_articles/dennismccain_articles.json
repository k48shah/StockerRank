Without the dividend I could see these shares rising to the mid $20s but that 11+% dividend will distribute a lot of that earnings power that would have normally gone into growing the business. It\u2019s a solid business with a solid dividend so it\u2019s worth owning the shares just for that reason. But if you\u2019re looking at it for capital gains, it may have a limited upside near $20. I hope that helps. \u2b50\ufe0f  I\u2019ve mentioned this in the past but if you\u2019re looking purely for high dividend trades, more and more of my investable funds are being put into the YieldMax funds.

By letting the shares go and going back into cash, I not only have the potential to sell Puts next week, I have the potential to sell Puts in something unrelated.

Technically it\u2019s in a nice channel and currently it\u2019s at the lower portion of that channel, so it\u2019s a good buying opportunity. The things that bothers me are the future earnings estimates. You may know more than the analysts but this super cycle of doubling earnings may not last longer than this year. At least according to the analysts. So the shares have limited upside. Analysts have a price target of about $13 which is nice. And I think that\u2019s about right. However, if earnings exceed those guesses, and I believe you think they may, the stock could really take off. Aerospace and Defense is always a great area to be invested in.
