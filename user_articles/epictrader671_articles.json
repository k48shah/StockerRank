        "content": "Personal thoughts on the market: \n$SPY is hitting ATH yet small caps are being hit the hardest. Statistically, small caps perform poorly in Q2 and Q3, but large/mid caps either stay neutral or perform positively. From the start of the pandemic up until March of this year the markets were easy to predict and everyone (new and experienced) were making gains as if this was a normal thing in the market. \nPeople know that most of my posts are in relation to small caps because of the high volatility and low float. The small cap market will start heating up again heading towards Q4 and Q1 but if you decide to take swings be sure to stay disciplined with your risk reward ratio and know when to mentally stop out of your position. Small caps are already oversold IMHO, but there is no consistent momentum follow through so be patient and strictly stick to your plan! Never place all your eggs in one basket. It is close to impossible to call the bottom, but you can dollar cost average during fear.",

It is exam week for me and I had a big paper that was due this morning, so I was extremely busy and stressed with uni work this week. I will be posting tomorrow, but I just want to say thank you guys for your understanding especially when I am busy. \nQuick thoughts of the market: markets are recovering nicely after that healthy pullback last week, I want $SPY to hold/consolidate above 386-388+ to show bullish conviction. Small caps are not performing as crazy as they were a few weeks back so psychologically still a bit of fear and uncertainty as small caps were hit the largest during the pullback (crushed a lot of new retail traders/investors) IMHO. \n\nCheers guys and have a blessed and safe great day! :)",

Over the weekend Senate passed Biden\u2019s 1.9 trillion covid relief bill(good short-term, bad long-term). The Fed can continue printing to fix a short-term problem, but all it does is weaken and add on to our already hyper inflated economy. Last Friday showed strong bullish conviction. A ton of hot penny names in multiple sectors that were overextended back then have filled their major gap-down support level and bounced strongly. SPY needs to close over and consolidate in between 386-388+ to show bullish confidence in this market. Until then technically speaking, bears are still in control but those that took advantage and loaded the dips w/ me on high conviction plays during the time of panic selling and fear will reap the biggest reward! Small caps got hit the hardest but they have reseted the charts for people that love swings to get in at solid major support with a better risk reward ratio.",

During times of uncertainties I highly suggest to dollar cost average on your high conviction plays (never go all in). Think long-term: what sectors/themes will do well when the market returns back to normal. Remember, pullbacks are healthy and needed to build bullish momentum and they give us opportunities to load up on high conviction names at a discount. Fundamental analysis is just as important as technical analysis. Understand gap-fills (gap-up/gap-down) based off the long-term chart if the market sells off often times there will be panic selling and people who understand gap-fills will place heavy bids at those areas to get the best possible bottom entry.

Pullbacks give us opportunities to load up confidently on high conviction tickers that are selling at a discount. I don\u2019t want you guys to be buying at the top\u2026 EUPHORIA + FOMO trading especially as new retail traders/investors enter the market are early signs of a major pullback(psychologically entering when markets are at a high). I will update you guys if bulls manage to break key rising wedge resistance w/ strong volume or when this reaches healthy mini pullback to 375-380 or healthy big pullback to 345-360.

Most day/swing traders use the 5m, 15m, 30m,1h,4h, and the daily time frame when trading(I mainly use the daily, 5m, and 15m because it helps me determine the strength of the stock better). IMO, the terms spike, breakout, gapper can all be used interchangeably, and when I called out WWR on watch for a potential breakout a close over 3.00 and a close over 3.20 I mean there is strong resistance there and if a candle is able to close over it with volume as confirmation then it could be a major runner which it was. \nHere is the daily chart (top picture) and the 5 minute chart(bottom picture) of $WWR: key breakouts close over 3.00--> 3.20-->3.70\n\n***Please feel free to join the FREE discord room (an awesome trading community made by TradingKingEric) in my link below to learn more about trading (terminology, patterns, lessons, etc.) :)",

However, I do no see a good entry until signs of confirmation (a close over 8ema with stronger volume than its declining days)or until it reaches its bottom descending support line around 1.52 or below. IMHO bears are still in control of this name and bulls will make stronger buying pressure when it hits its bottom descending support line. \nCheers and have a great day! :)",

I would personally be bearish a close under 1.50. Keep in mind this is an extremely oversold oil name IMO. However, a disciplined trader would wait for stronger signs of support (not just psychological but technical too) or signs of confirmation before making an entry. \nI will add this oil name to my WL as this is one of the oil names that is oversold and due for a reversal soon, and a name that gets some pretty nice consistent 400k volume avg. When momentum starts picking up for the oil sector I will definitely have this as one of my top watches.\nI will be looking for a close over 8EMA(1.73) then back to its descending channel's resistance (2.00) for reversal confirmation. PT 1.80-2.00/2.50-3.20/4.50-4.80+\nCheers man, and have a great day! :)",
