At current prices, we believe the market is pricing in Ubisoft's ability to fully execute on its FY24 guidance while delivering materially higher LT cash margins incl. SBC (>25% vs. FY19 peak of 14%). Material risks exist in our view based on past execution (UBSe 6% below FY24 non-IFRS EBIT guidance). FY24 guidance will require Ubisoft to successfully deliver the biggest front book revenue performance in its history despite expecting back catalogue to decline post a poor FY23 release slate and a soft consumer backdrop. Moreover, FCF generation remains poor (negative in 5 of the last 10 yrs) and on our estimates will only turn FCF positive in FY26 assuming full cost out execution (\u20ac200m by FY26). Also, while sector M&A is elevated, we believe the agreement with Tencent in Sept-22 limits options. The Ubisoft forward is on 12 June.\" Bearish",

With the recent sell-off in the SaaS space, Shopify's valuation has come down to a more reasonable level. In our view, Shopify has plenty of growth levers remaining, including enterprise, international, and take-rate. Give these dynamics, we believe Shopify can increase its revenue more than twice the e-commerce growth rate over the next several years, resulting in 30%-plus growth in a bull-case scenario, in our view. This revenue growth, coupled with maintaining a premium valuation, should drive shares to outperform the overall market and SaaS space. Risks to our upgrade include a further compression of multiples in the SaaS space, e-commerce growth coming in below our expectations of low teens over the next several years, Omicron potentially creating a near-term headwind to e-commerce sales, and a difficult first-quarter comp.\" Bullish",

Our $180 target price is unchanged. The basis for our upgrade is the pending acquisition of Zynga (ZNGA), which we think will help smooth earnings variability while offering compelling synergy opportunities.

But LUV's balance sheet is indeed a fortress situation, and they have truly washed out a multi-year cost scenario we can only assume is a worst case. LUV is exposed to the right end markets if they can execute better. We believe in LUV but we take a fresh look at our CASMx assumptions relative to the company's guidance they provided at the December analyst day and we conclude we were too optimistic. LUV expects 2022 CASMx of +8-12% y/3y followed by LSD average annual growth through 2026, after that. We assume flattish CASMx in 2023-24, which is still better than the guide.
