If one caught $ARKK at low of $35, they'd be +20% at 43 in just a week (if they don't follow back down).   \nOr... $U was down 86% (from 210 high tick down to low of 29.09). At today's 41.65 $U is still down 80%. That last $12/share round trip was 6% on the way down (from 210), but 40% back up (from 29.09) assuming my math is ok. That big percentage is hardly visible on the 1yr chart. \nProblems: Nobody catches the top/bottom tick, and profits can be given up just as quickly if the overall decline continues. If you don't have a stop, you could quickly have a new extended loss. I personally only try just above a support level or after a reasonably tight base (indicating where to put a tight stop). Not saying anything new here, and not recommending, but just wanted to share because of the number of stocks showing extreme declines.",

One concern would be buyer conviction. It seems the last 100 posts or so only mention the stock price; not the company, but at least a few people are watching approval process. Another concern might be that this took off on Jan 1, so there might be a non-news stimulus like people buying back in after taking tax losses?

If there is just a gradual transition the move will be slow and steady. The problem right now is, the cycle keeps getting delayed in phones/tablets.  Sooner or later, there will be a push for 5G and/or AR devices.   Just my opinion.",
