Per their quarterly report as of September, 2022, their balance sheet showed total assets of $243 million, and total liabilities of $153.5 million, for a net common stock equity of $89.5 million. Their quarterly reports from March, June and September of 2022 showed losses of -$62.6 million, -$33.3 million, -$43.6 million, respectively. So assuming they lost an average (of the last two quarters) of -$38 million for Q4 2022 and Q1 2023, they'd be down to: \n \n$89.5 - ($38 x 2) = $13.5 million left in total assets, minus all liabilities.

It shows a huge 1 year Falling Broadening Wedge, just like the one from Feb 2 to now that the Nasdaq broke out of just this past Tuesday (see my post history).  This same formation happened during the pandemic 2020 crash too.  After this formation completes, the market always rallies up. \n\nThis is how I knew the market bottoms were in.  Google \"Falling Broadening Wedge\".  Feds tightening cycle is over.  That was the worst the Feds were able to do.  Best times to buy are the bottoms when everyone's panic selling.

The charts predict free fall starts around $30-$31 and will drop into the mid to low $20s, probably $22 likely by late April/early May.  I don't seldom give dire warnings unless I truly expect it to come.  Good luck holding if you're going to bag hold this.  $TQQQ on the other hand should head to the low $30s, most likely the $32 area.  $SPY should hit the $430s. Bullish",

Companies can simply stop hiring, and not have to do firings. This keeps the unemployment rate similar and prevents a recession just like I said.  Plus history says the stock market makes new all time highs AFTER the yield curve inverts and BEFORE recessions actually start, assuming there's even one.  This is a fact.  Almost every single yield curve inversion is followed by the market making new all time highs, and THEN a recession and a real sell off.

I found almost every single time yields inverted, stocks actually rallied to make new highs, or at least a double top before the real selling and real recession starts.  The yield curve has never been wrong.  However, it's interesting the father of the yield curve, Campbell Harvey, the man who discovered this, says he actually doesn't believe the yield curve is correct this time, citing unemployment rates are extremely low and no signs of major layoffs.  A study by the Feds (which you can Google) concluded you can use unemployment rates or yield curve inversions to predict recessions, and that unemployment rates were better at doing so. \n \nAfter inflation has peaks, history shows the market is usually double digits higher 12 months later.

Assuming the Rising Wedge pattern is realized and maintains its form (need a week or two to confirm), we should see the market continue to trend up to re-test the major resistance around 4,500-4,600, most likely around early fall, which is where trapped longs/retirees will dump. This pattern predicts a selloff, most likely to the 50% retrace level around 4,080 level, where it should recover and rally back to year end, closing anywhere from 4,200-4,400.  December is usually a good month, and if it closest higher as most analysts predict, shorts will panic cover at massive losses for tax loss harvesting.  That implies a new all time high, or double top would be in early to mid 2024.  Typically when yield curves invert, it takes about a year or more before a recession AND stocks typically make a new all time high or double top BEFORE the recession.  That's when we see the real selling. \n \nHOWEVER... (continue on next reply) Bullish",

With that formation the market will move across both upper and lower bound ranges in extreme \"manipulated\" ways. As time progresses, the wedge broadens (as its name implies), resulting in extreme wild movements scaling up and down the upper and lower bounds of the ranges.  Right now we're at the lower bound of this range, meaning it should rally hard back up 2-3% in a short time.  We saw a huge formation like this during the Trump Tariff Crash of 2018.  The thing about these formations is that once it's completed, it'll shoot up and above resistance and attempt to make a new high, or at least attempt to take out the original high that was part of this wedge initially.

It has a chart of earnings EPS YoY vs the S&P 500. It shows the earnings EPS has gone negative year over year. This only happened 4 times in the past 23 years. 3 of those 4 times, a recession followed with massive selling. Only 1 of those 4 times (in 2014), a recession didn't happen, BUT stocks still sold off.\n\nWhat's insane is stocks reported horrible earnings and outlook and many just kept rallying. Clearly, the Feds need to do more to stop this gambling.\n\nInflation MUST come down fast for a soft landing. If it doesn't, Feds MUST hike more rates. This eventually leads to a recession.

When this happens, the market will move with bigger and bigger intraday swings to hit the upper and lower bound ranges of the formation, until it finds a foundation (i.e. most likely the 50% retrace at around 11,200 on the $NASDAQ $COMP , and then rally back up, breaking the upper bound resistance and make higher highs.  I expect profit taking to take us down within the next week or two, and then after a solid base is formed for a week or two, we'll move back up to make higher highs.  The reason is the market cannot do 100% gains without healthy pullbacks.  We already did 1 year's worth of gains in 1 month.  Smart people and traders will take profit.

You can buy more shares with it or roll over covered calls higher and further out to capture more premium.

It's R0 is not that high.  It's a little higher than the seasonal flu's 1-2, but nothing like Delta at 6-7.  That exponential growth is a HUGE difference.  It's like compounding the S&P 500 gains at average 10% per year vs $UPRO at 25% a year.  In the longer run, 1% difference (1 R0) makes a HUGE difference.\n\nThis is basic math man.  Look.  The numbers do not lie.  Experts say the exact same thing I said, that even with a 100% effective vaccine, we'd need 90% of the population vaccinated to slow down Delta below R0 of 1. \n\nThese are my calculations.  Watch what the experts say (next post).

It already approached the $48K I predicted for a dead cat bounce.  I was right when I called the $3K lows a few years ago.  I'm pretty confident of my calls b/c Bitcoin has no backing like gold, so it simply trades based on charts.\n\nBut hey, as long as someone makes money in either direction, that's great.  Making money isn't about bag holding.  It's about knowing when to buy and when to sell.\n\ntwitter.com/bobdoleyahoo/st... Bearish",

The company warned the exact same thing, corroborating web analytics, that July was a dismal $57 billion in total transactions, as compared to 1 month averages of $112 billion in Q1 and $154 billion in Q2.\n\nQ3 is on track to be only a fraction of Q1 or Q3, and in fact, Coinbase warned worst case scenario, Q4 2021 will be identical to Q3 2021.\n\nIt's clear users left Coinbase midyear.
