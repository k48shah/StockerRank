It bagged the biggest-ever order of 2,100 electric buses worth Rs 3,675 cr from Mumbai\u2019s state-run public transporter. In March, it also won a contract for 550 electric buses from the Telangana state government. And a month before that, it announced a tie-up with Reliance Industries to develop hydrogen buses. \ud83d\udcb8\n\nSecondly, it had a KILLER FY23. Profits rose 86% to Rs 34 cr, while revenue jumped 84% to Rs 1,090 cr. FYI - Over the last 3 years, its revenue has grown at a CAGR of 97%, while net profit has grown 188%. \ud83d\udcca\n\nOlectra is also in an expansion phase. In Q4 FY23, Olectra entered the electric tipper biz. It also acquired 150 acres of land in Telangana to set up a new greenfield plant.

Reports indicate that the GOI may speed up the process of \u2018market coupling\u2019 in the power sector. As part of this, an independent entity will likely take charge of price discovery for spot power trading. Basically, a super exchange (mostly owned by GOI) will aggregate bids & offers across power exchanges to arrive at a uniform mkt clearing price.\n\nWhat does this mean? This SUCKS for IEX as it would increase competition and reduce their competitive edge. Currently, IEX enjoys an almost 100% market share in Day-Ahead Market (DAM) and Real-Time-Market (RTM) segments, which contributes to 75%-80% of its volumes. Experts believe that rivals will now start to chip away at its dominance. \n\nBottomline: IEX shot into the spotlight during the 2021 bull run, hitting an all-time high of Rs 295 p/sh.

Yes, even for people who can explain why they have large amounts of Rs 2,000 notes lying around. One quick way to spend that money is on high-value purchases like jewelry and land/flats.

Fun Fact: Its current order book is around Rs 84,000 cr; 3.5x its FY23 revenue. Also, the value of orders that it is likely to bag in the next 3 years is a WHOPPING Rs 1.2 lakh cr! \ud83d\ude0e\n\nSo what\u2019s driving the current rally? Firstly, the import of defence equipment has fallen (46% to 32% of the capex budget) in the last five years. This is a major POSITIVE. Given management guidance of 10%-15% growth, the stock is trading at 13.2x FY24 P/E, which is super attractive. \ud83d\udcb0\n\nLastly, reports indicate HAL may also be added to MSCI\u2019s India Standard Index.

The stock is set to gain BIG TIME from rival Go First\u2019s bankruptcy.\n\nThe case for a future rally is simple: In the March 2023 quarter, Go First had a market share of 7.8% and carried 29 lakh passengers. Its insolvency will remove 9% of domestic supply in the aviation sector. All players will benefit, but Go First\u2019s low-cost carrier brand means its customers are likely headed to IndiGo. \n\nCredit Suisse believes that leasing companies might allocate some of Go First\u2019s aircraft to Indigo as they share similar fleet types. FYI - this is what happened with Spice Jet when Jet Airways collapsed.\n\nBeyond this, there are other positive triggers:\n\n1) Travel demand is BOOMING. India\u2019s domestic air traffic hit a record high on April 30. Also, 38 million passengers flew in just the first three months of 2023, a 52% YoY bump.\n\n2) Price of aviation turbine fuel has dropped over the last 3 months due to a softening in global oil prices.

The airline argues that P&W refused to supply it with spare engines, in violation of an arbitration order. \n\nBut, there were other issues too. GoFirst began to seriously struggle post-Covid. In FY22, Go First recorded its biggest-ever loss of Rs 1,808 cr. The airline\u2019s market share nearly halved to 6.9% in March 2023. \n\nSo, who are the other major losers in this debacle?\n\nThe banks. Go First owes over Rs 5,500 cr to a clutch of lenders. Its insolvency filing says Central Bank of India (-5%) has the highest exposure of Rs 1,561 cr. Bank of Baroda (Rs 1,423 cr) and Deutsche Bank (Rs 1,320 cr) are the other big lenders.   \n\nOther Wadia group firms. In particular, Bombay Burmah Trading Co and Bombay Dyeing fell 5%-6% each.",

To read the full story subscribe to Daily Rip India newsletter)\n\nAtul Auto has two plants in Gujarat, with a total annual capacity of 120K units. It has also set aside 45 acres of land in Ahmedabad for future expansion. FYI: in 2021, it became a supplier for a major 1 lakh unit tender put out by the GOI-run Convergence Energy Services. \u267b\ufe0f\n\nThe current rally is due to its phenomenal financial performance in FY23. A 60% YoY increase in sales (25,549 units vs 16,051 units). In Q2, the company returned to profit after five quarters of straight losses. And, ICYMI: veteran investor Vijay Kedia raised his stake in the company to 8.4% earlier this month. \ud83d\udcaf\n\nThe big picture? The 3-wheeler market, globally and in India, is shifting to electric and CNG. Atul Auto\u2019s opportunity is to cash in on that. Bullish",

They are essential for connecting people and driving business, making them the engines of growth and development.\n\n3/ For example, imagine a Govt investing in infrastructure projects, it creates jobs and income for people, who in turn have more money to spend on other things, generating more jobs and income for other people in the process. This chain reaction is called the multiplier effect. \n\n4/ The GOI has been pouring massive investments to upgrade and modernize the country\u2019s infrastructure. Last year, they announced that they will spend a whopping Rs 7.5 lakh crore to build new roads, homes, dams, and other projects. Bullish",

As part of the deal, Vi had assured the Govt that they would invest Rs 10,000 cr from their own pockets. But, they\u2019ve failed to do so. Consequently, the GOI has decided to delay the equity conversion of its debt, which is a huge NEGATIVE! \ud83d\udc4e\n\nVi desperately needs funds to continue its operations. To fix this, they went to SBI and a bunch of other banks to borrow money. But, the banks refused to give them a loan as there is no clarity on GOI\u2019s stake and fund infusion by promoters. PS - Vi already owes more than Rs 15,000 cr to banks. \ud83e\udd2f\n\nAs I\u2019ve always said, finding a sustainable and scalable business model is priority #1 for Vi.

        "content": "$RELIANCE.NSE Seems like mota bhai is getting ready to take the leadership. The past 6 months, RIL has barely moved (+1%) vs $NIFTY50.NSE gaining nearly 18%. \n\nThe main reason for this underperformance was the shock windfall tax on fuel exports imposed by the GOI back in July. As oil prices have cooled off, refining margins have shrunk sharply. Experts are optimistic that Govt may soon withdraw the hefty duties. PS - they did so in case of steel as well. \n\nIf that were to happen, RIL\u2019s refining margins may move up by $2 per barrel. This translates to a $1 billion gain on the EBITDA front, which is a massive W!!! \n\nBesides this, telecom and retail are also killing it. Jio continues to grow faster than industry as per latest TRAI data. Reliance Retail successfully launched its FMCG business under the \u201cIndependence\u201d brand last week. \n\nWatch out for this one \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 Bullish",

While we believe MFI is not underpenetrated, especially in east India, we expect Bandhan to finally benefit from the cyclical recovery in MFI collections/growth. Its non-MFI portfolio is now growing consistently and provides some diversification. We cut our estimates by 26% for FY23 and 3-5% FY24/25CL and expect provisioning to ease from 4QFY23. We expect FY24/25CL ROEs at ~20%. Multiples at 1.6x FY24 book look cheap and hence we upgrade Bandhan Bank to BUY from O-PF on normalising MFI cycle. Bullish",

And Apple at that time, I think it was around $700 billion. \n\nAnd I said it required incredible execution, at least some luck, and we did indeed achieve that. Tesla went, in fact, or passed Apple\u2019s market cap at the time. \n\nAnd now, I have the opinion that we can far exceed Apple\u2019s current market cap. In fact, I see a potential path for Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. \n\nSo, now that doesn\u2019t mean it will happen or that will be easy.
