They used money from the business to pay for other investments, and when those became more valuable, they shut down the textile operations in 1985, but kept the name.  \n  \nBerkshire continued to add properties, and now owns more than five dozen  subsidiaries. Buffett\u2019s ability to spot undervalued companies and scoop up their stocks before they take off turned him into a legendary investor, earning the nickname the \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d after the Nebraska city where Berkshire is based.   \n  \nForbes ranks Buffett as the 6th richest person in the world, with $105.6 billion in assets.",

This means that the bond\u2019s value will keep pace with inflation, making it a safe investment when you expect inflation to be high. As a tradeoff for this lower risk, TIPS offer a lower yield than normal Treasury bonds of an equivalent duration. This creates a way to measure bond-buyers\u2019 inflation expectations, because TIPS yields will fall if investors think inflation will be high, as they are willing to sacrifice more yield for inflation protection.

Ford said employees would get $5 an hour for an eight-hour shift, up from the previous $2.34 for a nine-hour workday. \n  \nFord made the decision in an effort to keep his assembly line workers from leaving for other jobs. Many found the repetition at Ford\u2019s history-making manufacturing method tedious, and by the end of 1913 the turnover rate was 380%.   \n  \nThe news sent thousands of job seekers flocking to the plant, overwhelming the carmaker and leading to riots. Police used fire hoses to disperse the crowd, and Ford announced that only those who had been local residents for at least six months could apply. \n \nSource: The Henry Ford \nFord Highland Park, Mich. factory, 1913 \nHulton Archive / Getty Images",

He spent years attempting to perfect a method that would prevent it from melting in high heat. While working at the Eagle India Rubber Company, he combined rubber and sulfur on a hot stove and found it not only didn\u2019t melt, it actually hardened. \n \nIt took several more years for Goodyear to perfect his formula. In 1844 he patented his process. He called it vulcanization after Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. \n \nSadly for Goodyear, he spent much of the fortune he made on his invention fighting patent infringement cases. He died $200,000 in debt in 1860. The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company was named in his honor. Sports fans today are reminded of his work when the Goodyear Blimp passes over stadiums around the country. \nSource: CT History \nTom Szczerbowski/Getty Images",

Today it fell 11.41% from Friday's close to land on the 14th-worst day in five years. \n \nThe opening gap was down 4.59%, the 37th-worst in five years; i.e., things started out badly, but not horribly. They ended worse. If there was a saving grace, it was that volume, at just over 200 million shares traded, was middling: no full-bore sprint for the exits. On a money-traded basis, it was the 274th worst day in the period. True range, at 10.00%, was biting. \n \nIt was the 5th bottom-20-in-5-years day for the year. There has only been one top-20-in-5-years day so far in 2022, with three trading days to go. By the way, there has not been a top-20-in-5 Friday in the entire five-year period, so that leaves little room for an end-of-year comeback. The stock has fallen 72.72% year-to-date.",

Bowerman, a track-and-field coach at the University of Oregon, and his former student, Phil Knight, were dissatisfied with the design of American running shoes, and would form a company in 1964 to market a lighter running shoe that Bowerman designed. In 1968, that company became Nike, named after the Greek goddess of victory. Today, Nike is the world\u2019s largest athletic footwear and apparel company.   \n \nSource: Massachusetts Institute of Technology \nKirby Lee / Contributor / Getty Images",

This mathematical framework is used to build a portfolio of investments that maximizes the amount of expected return for a given level of risk. \n  \nAmerican economist Harry Markowitz pioneered this theory in his paper \"Portfolio Selection,\" published in the Journal of Finance 70 years ago this year, in 1952. He was later awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on modern portfolio theory. The Nobel Prize was established 127 years ago today, on 27 November 1895. \n  \nA key component of modern portfolio theory is diversification. Most investments are either high risk and high return, or low risk and low return. Markowitz argued that investors could achieve their best results by choosing an optimal mix of the two based on an assessment of their individual tolerance to risk.",

After several months of uncertainty over whether Musk would go through with the deal, he eventually gained control last month, taking Twitter private.

From August 1921 until September 1929, the Dow had soared six-fold, from 63 to 381.  \n \nHowever, concerns about the gains led to gyrations in the market, especially with so many investors buying equities on margin. When trading opened on Oct. 24, the Dow plunged 11%, and a panic set in as those who purchased stocks with little money down had to dump shares to cover their losses. The selling continued throughout the day, with the average closing down 21% from the highs set the month before.   \n \nIcon Communications / Getty Images",

But also, I could accept execution and go short if we're above 85 on expiration day. In such a scenario, if the likelihood that COIN would go back below 85.39 while I held on to the short is over 50%, I would decrease my risk further. \n \nIf you get into a car, you could die in a crash.

Within two years, he brought in some of the biggest carmakers of that time, including Oldsmobile, Cadillac, Oakland (later named Pontiac), and the predecessors of GMC Truck. \n  \nDebt from acquisitions led to his loss of control of the company in 1910. Durant left GM and founded the Chevrolet Motor Company in 1911. He returned in 1916, bringing Chevrolet with him. \n  \nGM held the title of world\u2019s biggest automaker for decades, but it was in danger of collapse during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. It declared bankruptcy in June 2009 and received a government bailout.

It was the biggest bankruptcy in history. \n  \nAt the time, Lehman was the fourth-largest investment bank in the U.S., with $619 billion in assets. However, the value of its holdings in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) tumbled along with the subprime mortgage market, putting the company in danger of collapse. \n  \nCalls for a government bailout of the bank were rejected, but soon the demise of Lehman began a cascading crisis in the financial sector that threatened a global economic meltdown. A few weeks later, Congress passed the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to support the industry.   \nMario Tama / Getty Images",

Ltd., with initial capital of 12 million yen, to design and produce automobiles. The Toyodas, who ran a family-owned business producing spinning and weaving equipment, spent nearly a decade of their \"spare time\" making prototypes of compact, affordable cars in the hopes that they would appeal to Japan's working class. Their hard work eventually paid off, and Toyota became an international success. Toyota reported $27.2 trillion yen in global revenue in 2021, or about $245 billion\u00b9. About 90% of Toyota's revenue comes from automotive sales.  \n \n[\u00b9For comparison, Tesla annual revenue for 2021 was $53.8 billion. That's about 22% of Toyota's. $TM $TSLA] \n  \nSource: Toyota \nRalph Orlowski / Staff / Getty Images",

[Enterprise value today: $1.57 trillion. And, today, old enough to vote.] \n  \nThe stock was priced in its initial public offering (IPO) at $85, with shares sold through a Dutch Auction. However, when trading began on the Nasdaq just before noon, the shares immediately hit $100. The price slipped to $95.96, but then recovered, rising as high as $104.06 before ending the day up 18% at $100.34. Some 22 million shares were traded, more than the 19.6 million sold in the IPO.   \n  \nGoogle shares fell to their all-time lows less than a month later, but have steadily climbed since then. Now trading as Alphabet ($GOOGL), the stock is priced more than 5,000% higher than it was on its opening day.   \n  \nSource: Wall Street Journal \nGetty Images",
