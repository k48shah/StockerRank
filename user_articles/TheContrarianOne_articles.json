It's bullish because our financial institutions are still strong, unlike 1931. It's bullish because employment is still strong and the reduction in the M2V shows that a soft landing is doable.

So going into 2022 China will hopefully start to ease Covid restrictions, economy can get back to a more normal footing and thus create more growth opportunities for Tencent. Also important to mention it appears China is about to put the brakes on the regulatory front, so no more pain should really be from that.  \n \nAnother important note, the Cloud and Business Services were up big in the quarter. Up about 25% which is going to be a big growth driver going forward. \n \nI would like to hear about a buyback program though. Overall still bullish.

What I mean is, what was the employment rate at and what was the consumer spending looking like, on top of inflation. \n \nI would be surprised if let's say in the past 4-5 US recessions that employment and consumer spending looked as good as it does now.  \n \nThat's what's so interesting about the situation we're in right now. Employment is incredibly strong, consumer spending is through the roof AND household budgets are very well within their traditional parameters. All while the yield curve continues to invert..  \n \nIt begs the question, if a recession is coming, where is it coming from exactly?",

Yes, they could.. but what makes people think that's a death sentence? The Hang Seng is MORE than capable of handling these listings independently. Do people forget that Tencent become a nearly $750 billion dollar market cap exclusively as a Hong Kong listed company? The capital is there in Hong Kong.. these Chinese companies don't need the NSYE or Nasdaq really.  \n \nIn a lot of ways, I kind of look forward to Alibaba being delisted. At least then I wouldn't have to listen to people losing their minds over the delisting.. \n \nAnd if they do delist.. guess what? You'll still have an OTC to trade, like Tencent has in the US. These regulations from the HFCAA is to delist companies from US exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, ARCA, CBOE) etc. That doesn't not include OTC or pink sheets..",

You're essentially buying with the high likelihood it will be higher (possibly significantly higher) in the next two years. I know two years is a long time, but if you're a long term investor it's not and there is no way with the growth profile this has it's going to be trading at a 2-3x p/s ratio in 2023-2024.. Bullish",

You take it out two years then we're talking a 3x p/s ratio give or take (and that's assuming the stock price is stagnant).  \n \nSo yes, SoFi is expensive, but with their growth prospects it's a great investment for a long term investor. Sure, you can try to time it if you want, but that's a tough game to play and you may miss the train if you do that.  \n \nRising interest rates and the bank charter will allow them to aggressively lend their own deposits and enter the housing market is FULL force.  \n \nThis is a buy and hold.. buy it and forget about it.

However, even if China matches their stock market cap percentage with their GDP percentage, we're talking about the market tripling or possibly quadrupling by the time that happens.. and that's just the MARKET, not individual names, which could have serious outsized gains. \n\nThe US is a fine place to invest, but the opportunity, the really outsized gains, are here in China.

Think of wealth like a snowball that you are trying to roll. Sure it starts off small, but overtime as long as you keep rolling the \"snowball\" and not withdrawing money then you'll get to this number. From there, compound interest takes hold and before you know it $100,000 turns into $200,000, 200 into 400, 400 into 800 and so on. \n\nBe smart with your money, save as much as you can early in your life and you will thank yourself.. take it from me!
