From last Thursday to yesterday $UPST went up 3x in 3 days then yesterday pulled back 28% to under $119 which puts the market cap under $8.9 billion -- this means $UPST is under 18x sales with at least 115% revenue growth with gross margins at 84% and contribution margins at 46%. $UPST is now way too cheap at $118 and could be back to $150+ in the next few weeks if the markets stabilize.",

In all my years of investing I don't think I've ever seen a company with metrics this strong. \n\n$FUTU has pulled back from the late February highs of $205 and the more recent pre-earnings levels in the $140s all the way down to $115 as of yesterday's close. This is laughable. \n\nBased on analysts estimates, $FUTU should do $900 million to $1.1 billion in 2021. Let's split the difference and say $1 billion. This mean means $FUTU is now trading at 15x sales with at least 120% revenue growth, 79% gross margins and 45% net margins. \n\nI think $FUTU could be a $200 stock in the next few months especially once we see the Robinhood valuation and what that P/S multiple might be.",
