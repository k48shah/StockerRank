We think Tinder's higher prices and further user \nadoption of Hinge with minimal cannibalization of Tinder will return growth to the top line, which, \ncombined with continuing cost controls and lower user acquisition costs due to the firm's network \neffect, will expand margins this year and in 2024. We were also pleased with the firm's longer-term \ncapital allocation strategy to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders, more likely in the \nform of share buybacks.

Our new survey data suggests otherwise, with online dating penetration increasing from 9% in May 2021 to 11% in April 2023, while the portion of adults who have never used online dating declined from 60% to 54% over the same timeframe . When narrowing it to individuals that are single & looking for a relationship, still only ~1/3rd currently use online dating 1/4th have never tried it . Notably, there has been an uptick in active Gen-Z online dating users, growing from ~10% to ~15% over the past year , we believe this survey shows various positive data points around online dating user trends,relative to 2022, that help the market may not be as mature as some believe, in-line with our thesis for above consensus market growth Bullish",

TO STRONG BUY FROM BUY \n3:36 pm ET May 12, 2023 (CFRA) Print \nWe reduce our 12-month target to $44 from $65 on a P/E of 16x our '24 EPS view, below historical to reflect lower growth. We cut our '23 EPS view to $2.23 from $2.80 and '24's to $2.75 from $3.08. MTCH posts Q1 EPS of $0.54 vs. $0.77, missing the $0.56 consensus view. Revenue fell 1% as total payers fell 3%, while revenue per payer (RPP) rose 1%. Hinge is a bright spot (+27%), led by new subscription tiers (HingeX and Hinge+) and international expansion. Although Tinder has been a disappointment recently (flat sales Y/Y), we see growth accelerating starting Q2 (mid-single-digit percent), as higher price points more than offset payer declines (April trends provide greater conviction). Exiting '23, we think growth will accelerate to 10%-15% on easier comps and improving Tinder/Hinge growth. Bullish",

Capitulation often occurs at the end of a panic selling cycle. During adverse market conditions, such as a period of declining stock prices or high volatility, investors may sell stock they planned to hold long-term to avoid losing more money. The point of capitulation is a sign that they believe the stock is no longer worth keeping in their portfolios. Bullish",

We are confident in RUN's ability to replace the $40M undrawn credit facility that it had with SVB. Shares have overcorrected, in our view, as investors fear for community solar project financing, of which SVB financed >60% of in the U.S. in 2022. To put this into context, the U.S. cumulatively has ~142 GW of installed capacity and community solar represents less than 4% of the total. We expect RUN shares could continue to face pressure in the short term due to added financing and tax credit realization uncertainties, but with shares trading at 5.7x forward revenue, we think the sell off is Bullish",

We begin our '22 and '23 EPS estimates at $2.72 and $2.91, respectively. Despite a deteriorating macro outlook  & uncertainties surrounding the interest rate/inflationary environment, we believe a 70% decline in shares and significant multiple compression now makes MTCH's valuation enticing , given its industry lead position in the dating services arena. We would also argue that MTCH's sub-based model will remain sticky and should hold up well, while unfavorable forex and tough comparisons will act as headwinds for the remainder of the year. Most important to our bullish view, we think Tinder  could see growth accelerate in 2023, driven by improved product execution as well as easier comparisons, while Hinge continues to be a major growth driver through '23.
