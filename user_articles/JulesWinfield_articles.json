Hopefully she can impress on the upcoming Q2 call, because she wasn\u2019t allowed to say much on the last one. \n\nLastly, seems intuitive that the CMS reductions will fuel consolidation of a very fragmented PT market.

        "content": "$ATIP  I think the most important aspects of the recent Jefferies and Hedgeye comments are: \n\n1. Evidence of increased patient traffic \n2. Evidence of increased hiring and reduced employee attrition\n\nIt\u2019s well reported that $ATIP was ruthlessly brutal in cutting costs during Covid. That behavior caused employee attrition to spike to ~80% in late 2020.\n\nA silver lining is that there is likely a bigly amount of operating leverage baked into $ATIP that should more than offset higher employees expenses over time, assuming of course that employment and patient visits continue to improve\n\nNote that the smaller clinics that comprise the bulk of the PT market have the same labor cost issues, without the scale benefits of the largest PT practices. Smaller size also limits a clinic\u2019s ability to earn high CMS MIPS scores high enough to offset CMS\u2019s expected deep cuts in PT reimbursements, unlike $ATIP who earns high MIPS scores. \n\nPT industry consolidation should accelerate at some point Bullish",

Focus on rate sensitive (e.g. sensitive to stable/falling long term interest rates) names.\nMy two largest core L-T positions are $INFU and $IRIX. \n\nTwo other low dollar price micro  cap names I own and like longer term are $DMIFF and $BWLK. I think both stocks could potentially double+ over the next 2-3 years. Be smart about entry prices and expect volatility a long the way.\n\nAnother potential high octane idea is $FTCH if it drops to $20 or lower. Chart is broken but the company isn\u2019t. I lightened up after the Q3ER and hope to reload but want to avoid the falling knife \n\nI\u2019ve been following breakoutinvestors.com/ for small-cap ideas. Free website where I learned about $DMIFF and $BWLK They generally attract a much higher concentration of thoughtful/analytical investors compared to other platforms I\u2019ve used.

For example, coincident with the integration of Topcon, $IRIX mgmt split their salesforce into two discrete entities\u2014 Glaucoma and Retina\u2014that reflect the  substantial differences in both end markets. Glaucoma salesforce is focused on increasing G6 system utilization rates which means they\u2019re focused high margin (and single use) G6 probe sales (recurring revenue). $IRIX  Retina/Pascal salesforce is focused on selling retina laser systems which are more of a capital equipment sale. \n\nThe difference in the two sales groups can be explained by contact with eyeballs during the relevant procedures. e.g. Glaucoma MicroPulse treatments require G6 Probe contact with the eye (e.g. single use probes = recurring rev.)

Fixing the company would probably reduce their exposure to that litigation by a large amount. \n\nYou might remember that the stock traded up sharply after the Q3 earnings call, and then reversed lower on $ATIP\u2019s Q3 10Q disclosure that they had received a voluntary request for information from the SEC. Seems likely that Advent/Fortress/ATI mgmt are focused on fixing the company, not taking it private.",

A turnaround could also happen sooner, and the stock will probably move well before the company files an \u201call clear\u201d quarterly earnings release, assuming mgmt has gotten its act together wrt hiring and increasing patient visits, which is my view after listening to the Q3 call.\n\nGiven their available liquidity they seem to have at least 12 months to turn things around. \n\nThere are obviously no guarantees.
