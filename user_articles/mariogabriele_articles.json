Competition has really stepped up. $BKNG offers short-term rentals. $EXPE acquired HomeAway which fulfills a similar need.\n\n2. COVID was as bad to the business as we might have guessed. Booking growth dropped 72% YoY in April; revenue down 32% YoY over the first 9 months of 2020. Credit to the team for surviving and righting the ship.\n\n3. Regulation could remain an impediment. It's gummed up the wheels in the past and certainly hangs over other sharing economy businesses like $UBER and $LYFT.\n\nIf you're interested in getting our full briefing on $ABNB ahead of the IPO, sign up here: thes1club.com/.",
