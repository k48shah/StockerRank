A week ago, bulls were in peril, the White House was talking the market lower even as the indexes tested the 200 day moving average, trade wars were developing on multiple fronts, and everyone was bearish.\n\nFlash forward to today. Mergers are back, with a big $CRM deal, and a $RTX and $RTN merger, too. Analysts are bullish again. Despite the trade war, semiconductor maker $ADI got an upgrade this morning.\n\nAnd the Fed, despite full employment, is talking about cutting short term interest rates, which is crazy.\n\nEverything is falling into place for bulls. Or so it seems.\n\nTraders should keep in mind that there is resistance in the 290 area. That level may be a near term magnet for bulls.\n\nstocktwits.com/r/Risk_Rewar...",
