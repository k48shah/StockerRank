We also can see a false positive in 1998 where the spread went negative for a short period. In the last recession, the spread went negative a couple of different times before rising. \n \nIf we use the first negative spread date as our starting point, the average number of weeks leading up to a recession is 37, or about nine months. If we use the last positive spread date after being negative before a recession, the average is 17 weeks, or 4.25 months and the median is 14 weeks, or 3.5 months.\" \n \n$ZT_F $ZN_F $BONDS $STUDY $FED  \nSource: advisorperspectives.com/dsh...",

At least, that's how it played out peak 2008 when we were neck deep in blood and bile. \n \nFor my trading, I have reduced my position sizing by 1/2 of what I normally swing. I'm doing that is because I don't want to be \"large\" if there is after-hours Fed speak, but I still want to trade the prevailing trends. \n \nTrading market volatility isn't overly difficult if you stick with your rules, or sit on your hands. Now is probably not the best time to put on a \"yolo lotto ticket\" trade with banks folding. \n \nHave a great weekend. Cheers! \u2615 \n \n $STUDY",
