The fact that is hit a 52 week high right before earnings just exasperated things because many technical traders sell the 52 week high as part of their discipline.

I think the Call buyers at $500 to $530 should be safe and those at $540 and $550 could be okay but anyone who has $560+ Calls on the LONG side could be in trouble. Many sold Covered Calls as volatility increased and those Calls became very expensive to buy so selling them made perfect sense. Bullish",

There are some who are still having problems due to other underlying health issues. 99.9% of the people dying from Covid-19 and that\u2019s the truth. The vaccine is preventing massive amounts of deaths. Undeniable FACT! Once you get the majority of people vaccinated, the spread slows down. I am not sure Covid-19 will go away permanently. The Flu never has gone completely away. I am quite certain that Moderna with their new technology, will in-fact get better flu vaccines out and quicker. Moderna is just getting started. Stop fighting a losing fight. We can all get back to our lives if people stop being dumb about the vaccine. Stay home and be a hermit or come out in society VACCINATED!! Bullish",

However, IMOP $182.40 was a previous base that cratered, broke the next level of support sold off heavily there as you can see by the big red bars, then recovered but failed to break trend. I has now broken trend then fell back at trend. A false break out and re-test of trend. IMOP, this is the last test of this area as we head towards earnings. IF it breaks that $182.50 mark, it will go to $200. So you can listen the bears and lose money or you can get in now before the herd. DIS is about to get it\u2019s mojo back. LOKI has been a huge catalyst this quarter for DIS+ and parks are PACKED! Don\u2019t wait and be behind the curve, get ahead of the curve and DIS will not disappoint you! Bullish",

The 1.7 Trillion tax cut allowed corporations 2 buy back stock at an all time high which meant the shareholders made $ The corps  did not hire more workers, they gave raises to the upper echelon & they got richer. Only DUMB ASS Trumpers think that a sell off in the market is bc of a Liberal conspiracy. So when the market went up for 7 weeks, it was bc of Trump but when it goes down it bc of Joe. IDIOTS!! The market has been going up based on liquidity & people were gambling. SAH stocks r getting pummeled & the reopening trade is on. JOE is responsible 4 the vaccine actually getting out now so people can go back 2 work. DJT NEVER focused on it! If Trump was Prez, we would still be stuck & sick!",

They would most likely start 3% to 5% down from the trading price so under $420. However, if you were bullish, you could SELL these 225 PUTS and collect over 1 million dollars in premium. They would tie up millions of capital for the next 60 days but if they think the stock is going up, this is easy money. Even if they get put the stock, they will own ROKU under $400.
