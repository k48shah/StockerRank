It is a mindset change for many... but oh so worth it IMHO. \n \nHemp is a revolution. Once people see the power, mindsets change. Hope comes in and stays. \n \nI feel so much guilt over plastics for example. Every time I think about how much oil (a non-renewable resource) goes in to plastics and then goes in the dump (or in the ocean), I get real mad at what we've done to our kids.  \n \nBut hemp has the power to change that. \n \nAnd \n \nSo many other things too!",
