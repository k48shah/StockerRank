Keeping a close eye on SPY this week if price fails to make new highs my set up is in play and we will be in a period of stagflation. Fundamental/ Catalyst for SPY downside: Over the past couple years SPY continue to grind to new high because of the Fed put. Feds was always there to print more money, and lower interest rates. but now that investors accepts that inflation is here, how can the fed push the market any higher, the more money they print the more inflation , interest rates cant go any lower. $SPY no longer has the fed to bail them out so what's next? (keep i mind every opinion is a Speculation, every trade i make the Stop loss has to be in my favor) Good luck all. Im shorting SPY here with a 1% stop loss above the all time high Bullish",
