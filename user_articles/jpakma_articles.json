Upon exercise the holder of the warrant writes a check to the company for the strike price and the shares are issued effectively capturing a gain of current price less strike price of warrant. This overhang exists for a while now and we need solid news to push us higher. \n\nI fully expect the news and the price increase as well as warrant exercise which is bullish long term.
