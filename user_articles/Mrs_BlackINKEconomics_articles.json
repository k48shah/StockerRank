So guessing what is going to happen or is causing the stock price issues is hard. But what I notice on the price drop Thursday and Friday, is that the relative vol and accumulationdistribution shot upwards. Those indicate a big rise in \u201cdemand\u201d just as the stock price was falling, which is counter to the typical Supply:Demand:Price relationship. \n\nSo even though we have no idea what\u2019s fundamentally causing this, the fact that forces big enough to be seen by the technicals were buying that dip is noteworthy, and I\u2019ll be taking a chance on it next week.

        "content": "@JBr0 @MRWALLSTREETBETS_ @MrPumpTrackerPro \nThanks Jbro! I remember learning about this back when they were in the news for NFTs, I always thought it sounded like a good vacation spot once it\u2019s done! Todays post was focused in on the fact that they secured their mobile gaming license and I\u2019m sure you saw but $MGSM, $MGAM, $SBET, $GMBL, $SLGG, and plenty of others, ran today within that sector. If that volume comes here, with the float impacted by the RS in December, things could get out of hand \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. \n\nThere are lots of risks in addition to opportunities if they\u2019re on phase 2. My first thought is where does the cash for phase 3 come from? I think I saw 2.60 cash/share. If they have to do an offering I\u2019d rather \u201cinvest\u201d after that Bullish",

It found $2 as the most recent support and the technicals have shifted into showing a potential big reversal if and when volume surges. \n\nPicking one low float Chinese ticker and waiting is a risky strategy.

But eventually the party ended and CGA started to sell off. While it seemed to gain credibility somewhere during 2022, it is still an awfully low float, highly volatile, American listed, Chinese company. And therefor we expect that traders are going to find it soon and volume might suddenly grow. Avg daily volume is UNDER 10k right now, so even a 100k day could lead to a major move. \n\nIt is risky, but the risk is diminished by the fact that 99% of Chinese companies have already rallied off their year lows.

High risk, high reward potential \ud83d\udc40 \n\nThe risks and reward potential have a lot to do with the warrant situation.  They did a large offering a few months ago (less?) which included warrants with an exercise price of 2.75. There have been a lot of low float pumps on tickers with warrants like this, and those pumps coincidentally happen to tickers that hedge funds like AEGIS holds. Similar to Sabby, Empry, others, these funds play the highest risk tickers and seem to manipulate the heck out of them. \n\nOur idea is that AEGIS is going to try get to that 2.75 exercise price, if they do they\u2019ll take a short position before they exercise the warrants.  Asking for 2.75 is a tall order. So if a pump happens it\u2019s never wrong to protect profits on the way up.

We have been playing so many Bitcoin miners for the last couple weeks, taking big moves off each. But CLSK hasn\u2019t been as active and there\u2019s no good reason for that. They managed their debt situation like professionals, and when Bitcoin prices plummeted, many mining companies went bk, and had extra inventory. CLSK took advantage and picked up a lot of mining capacity.  Now that extra capacity should start to pay off! \n\nYou can see the other 9 ideas by subscribing to the newsletter on our website, or just check the 4 others I posted here! Bullish",

We have been just loading and loading $LGHL since it\u2019s still cheap. Also, $SAI and $OLB seem to be being held down. As well as even bigger player $CLSK \n\nSince we\u2019re sharing credit, it was @Alchemy_Trader who informed me about SAI, which mines in Mexico and uses the heat in energy projects meant to drop the cost of their mining operations! So many opportunities still left, just gotta know where to look! Bullish",

With Singles Day (the biggest shopping event in the world) on Nov 11, low float Chinese tickers tend to see extra volume. Extra volume on a low float = price spikes. So clearly we will be watching the whole sector until Nov 12 \ud83d\ude18 \n\nWIMI is our favorite of the 2, the charts super bullish, the volumes not as low as you see on DXF. But if DXF has a breakout day, it could easily trounce WIMI.  Hard to pick just one heading into Singles Day! Spread and increase the probability you catch a runner or 2 \ud83d\ude18 Bullish",

For each day during the run from .58 to 14.53, each day the price had a steady low and a new high. Nobody ever challenged the range.\n\nEach Mon though, right at the start of the week, the algos would seemingly breakdown for an hour, the price would drop 20%+ (likely tagging every retail stop loss) only to be sent back up into the controlled bullish pattern. On Aug 19 when the algo fell apart, retail finally took notice and made it impossible for two algos to just manipulate it higher\u2026until\u2026\n\nThen retail got bored. Avg vol is 40k and each day the bid and the ask are offering WAY more than avg (300k+ shares on bid and ask). They aren\u2019t interested in filling those orders, they\u2019re just controlling the price again. Bullish",

Accumulationdistribution is supposed to measure supply and demand. If demand is up, 99% of the time so is the price. But here we have demand up with the price down!
