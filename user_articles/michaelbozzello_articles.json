        "content": "@acura22itr @Accidentfreak Hey all - wanted to close the loop here. FTX.US has a max sell/buy in coins of 99,999,999.00. We need to provide better messaging on the app and will add this in immediately. They did however provide us with more guidance into adding $KSHIB.X as tradeable(which we have now made available). KSHIB is 1 coin for every 1000 $SHIB.X coins. So those who are swinging bigger buys/sells can access the market of SHIB without these max quantity issues getting in the way. Thanks for the help here @acura22itr you are the best!",

Users who connect a brokerage get a verified badge next to their username. Once you connected your portfolio you can make it public or private. A private portfolio means only you can see your portfolio and holdings. If you choose to make your holdings public it exposes just your holdings and % change in performance. We NEVER show $ or Shares to other users. So for example my portfolio with $DOGE.X is public. So you'll se a verified icon for that holding when I post about it. You can also visit my profile and see my portfolio that is public and what holdings I'm sharing. Also we will never share this data with any third party period. Your credentials go through Plaid securely and are NOT held on the Stocktwits side.  Let me know if you have more questions!",
