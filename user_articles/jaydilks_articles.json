I just assumed they shorted DNA and now they will ride it all the way back up to $2.45 and determine whether to keep the investment. If they executed it perfectly, it bottomed on March 28th so that took about 4 months. It\u2019s it reasonable to think that about 3 months from now using the same trajectory it hits $2.45 ? Maybe. So on about July 23rd it\u2019s $2.45. It\u2019s a thought. I believe, using Technical Analysis, DNA is a bit like a Beach Ball being held under water. I bet you get 50% of that move in one day. No clue what day that is. Maybe not even Good News Dependent but it wouldn\u2019t hurt either to have genuine Good News with Cash Attached to the news. genomeweb.com/business-news...",

People who use TA typically buy and sell far more frequently and have characteristics of a day trader instead of an investor. If people were being honest, Technical Analysis would have largely kept people out of DNA as an investment for at least the last year including Friday. This goes both ways as there really aren\u2019t a ton of buy signals although the strength just crossed 50% of Friday that\u2019s the START of a trend reversal. If you don\u2019t subscribe to Technical Analysis but want to learn, the most basic way is to look at the following chart. Above the moving line is GOOD, below it is BAD. There\u2019s a bunch of loud naysayers that most have muted or blocked but their tune changes if/when the price closes above $1.39000 and stays there for 2-3 days. If it takes a week, that price is more like $1.375. Looking at the chart, it\u2019s flattened and pinched since early March. Those candles are getting compressed. Bullish",

These founders bootstrapped the business by buying stuff with their credit cards to get stuff off of EBay. They really did this. Doing that sort of thing sticks in your mind that can never be shaken. If I were a Forensic Psychologist, their $1.3 Billion in cash is a manifestation of NEVER having to feel like they are Financially leveraged again in their lives. They won\u2019t take on debt and they will always have a Financial Moat for $DNA and their personal lives. Each day they have sold is not like hearing bells go off in a Vegas Slot machine. Quite the contrary. It\u2019s FORCED SELLING. Perhaps the really odd share a dollar amount Jason Kelly just sold under 100,000 shares should tell you something. Perhaps he had a number for 2023, it was met and that\u2019s it. I could be wrong on this.  I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just inferring. Bullish",

The Founders have been FORCED SELLERS in two ways. First, the RSUs they received were in 2022. That\u2019s a taxable event immediately. It\u2019s EARNED INCOME at the price they were issued in October. That tax is due in 2 weeks to the IRS. There are no options but to sell at whatever price but it can\u2019t exceed 1% of the daily volume hence a ton of staggered sales. If the price was $20 per share in November, perhaps a handful of sales could have covered the tax Bill. They didn\u2019t even pay themselves from the first batch of sales that lasted months. Now they are paying themselves. This is what they have control over. They have not been living extravagantly for a decade. The Founders are all relatively young in their early 40\u2019s.

To be fair, DNA started the year at $1.69, so 9% above that is $1.84, if you have owned this since January 1.  I feel like I need to explain why I hold shares and have not sold. I have shares in a taxable and non-taxable account. The non-taxable 401K is truly something I won\u2019t touch until 2030. The other (about 50%) of the shares I own are shares I won\u2019t sell until, AT LEAST they are 1 year old to have a Longterm Capital Gain or a loss, potentially. I don\u2019t daytrade. I file jointly and am married so Gains are taxed at 15% after 365 days. A gain sold before this would be taxed at 32-37%.",

Money poured into  NOPE because he was SHORT ARKK and Tesla as his #1 and #2 top holdings. 62% of that cash has been evaporated by the wrong picks in 10 weeks. That is a new record for ETFs. It\u2019s the worst performing ETF in 2023. I think there\u2019s a fair chance his use of leverage is investigated by the SEC at some point.

The NOPE etf is an extreme example of HUBRIS as the Manager, George Noble has publicly lambasted ARK. Being 62% down in 65 days is tough to do but his Fund is over leveraged in shorting the wrong things like ARK, Tesla, Nvidia and further wrong that he has been Long Treasuries that have lost value. The reason I mention this is that he apparently has closed or is closing the short of ARKK. It was 40+% a week ago and today it\u2019s under 5%. He\u2019s not investing in ARKK but he has stopped betting against it\u2026\u2026\u2026..62% too late. I just wanted to pass this along. Bullish",
